<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate, read,
and write Zip archive files.
<P>

Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
<P>

Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings. Members
can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and enumerated.
They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments, or other attributes
queried or modified. Their data can be compressed or uncompressed as needed.
<P>

Members can be created from members in existing Zip files, or from existing
directories, files, or strings.
<P>

This module uses the Compress::Raw::Zlib library to read and write the
compressed streams inside the files.
<P>

One can use Archive::Zip::MemberRead to read the zip file archive members
as if they were files.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>File Naming</H3>



Regardless of what your local file system uses for file naming, names in a
Zip file are in Unix format (<I>forward</I> slashes (/) separating directory
names, etc.).
<P>

<TT>&quot;Archive::Zip&quot;</TT> tries to be consistent with file naming conventions, and will
translate back and forth between native and Zip file names.
<P>

However, it can't guess which format names are in. So two rules control what
kind of file name you must pass various routines:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">Names of files are in local format.<DD>


<TT>&quot;File::Spec&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;File::Basename&quot;</TT> are used for various file
operations. When you're referring to a file on your system, use its
file naming conventions.
<DT id="2">Names of archive members are in Unix format.<DD>


This applies to every method that refers to an archive member, or
provides a name for new archive members. The <TT>&quot;extract()&quot;</TT> methods
that can take one or two names will convert from local to zip names
if you call them with a single name.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Archive::Zip Object Model</H3>



<I>Overview</I>


<P>

Archive::Zip::Archive objects are what you ordinarily deal with.
These maintain the structure of a zip file, without necessarily
holding data. When a zip is read from a disk file, the (possibly
compressed) data still lives in the file, not in memory. Archive
members hold information about the individual members, but not
(usually) the actual member data. When the zip is written to a
(different) file, the member data is compressed or copied as needed.
It is possible to make archive members whose data is held in a string
in memory, but this is not done when a zip file is read. Directory
members don't have any data.

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERROR CODES</H2>



Many of the methods in Archive::Zip return error codes. These are implemented
as inline subroutines, using the <TT>&quot;use constant&quot;</TT> pragma. They can be imported
into your namespace using the <TT>&quot;:ERROR_CODES&quot;</TT> tag:
<P>



<PRE>
  use Archive::Zip qw( :ERROR_CODES );

  ...

  unless ( $zip-&gt;read( 'myfile.zip' ) == AZ_OK ) {
      die &quot;whoops!&quot;;
  }

</PRE>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="6"><FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> (0)<DD>


Everything is fine.
<DT id="7"><FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_STREAM_END</FONT> (1)<DD>


The read stream (or central directory) ended normally.
<DT id="8"><FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_ERROR</FONT> (2)<DD>


There was some generic kind of error.
<DT id="9"><FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_FORMAT_ERROR</FONT> (3)<DD>


There is a format error in a <FONT SIZE="-1">ZIP</FONT> file being read.
<DT id="10"><FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_IO_ERROR</FONT> (4)<DD>


There was an <FONT SIZE="-1">IO</FONT> error.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Compression</H3>



Archive::Zip allows each member of a <FONT SIZE="-1">ZIP</FONT> file to be compressed (using the
Deflate algorithm) or uncompressed.
<P>

Other compression algorithms that some versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">ZIP</FONT> have been able to
produce are not supported. Each member has two compression methods: the
one it's stored as (this is always <FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_STORED</FONT> for string and external
file members), and the one you desire for the member in the zip file.
<P>

These can be different, of course, so you can make a zip member that is not
compressed out of one that is, and vice versa.
<P>

You can inquire about the current compression and set the desired
compression method:
<P>



<PRE>
  my $member = $zip-&gt;memberNamed( 'xyz.txt' );
  $member-&gt;compressionMethod();    # return current compression

  # set to read uncompressed
  $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );

  # set to read compressed
  $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_DEFLATED );

</PRE>


<P>

There are two different compression methods:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="11"><FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_STORED</FONT><DD>


File is stored (no compression)
<DT id="12"><FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_DEFLATED</FONT><DD>


File is Deflated
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Compression Levels</H3>



If a member's desiredCompressionMethod is <FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_DEFLATED,</FONT> you
can choose different compression levels. This choice may affect the
speed of compression and decompression, as well as the size of the
compressed member data.
<P>



<PRE>
  $member-&gt;desiredCompressionLevel( 9 );

</PRE>


<P>

The levels given can be:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="13">&bull;<DD>
0 or <FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE</FONT>


<P>


This is the same as saying


<P>




<PRE>
  $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );

</PRE>


<DT id="14">&bull;<DD>
1 .. 9


<P>


1 gives the best speed and worst compression, and 9 gives the
best compression and worst speed.
<DT id="15">&bull;<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FASTEST</FONT>


<P>


This is a synonym for level 1.
<DT id="16">&bull;<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_LEVEL_BEST_COMPRESSION</FONT>


<P>


This is a synonym for level 9.
<DT id="17">&bull;<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT</FONT>


<P>


This gives a good compromise between speed and compression,
and is currently equivalent to 6 (this is in the zlib code).
This is the level that will be used if not specified.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Archive::Zip Methods</H2>



The Archive::Zip class (and its invisible subclass Archive::Zip::Archive)
implement generic zip file functionality. Creating a new Archive::Zip object
actually makes an Archive::Zip::Archive object, but you don't have to worry
about this unless you're subclassing.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Constructor</H3>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="18">new( [$fileName] )<DD>



<DT id="19">new( { filename =&gt; $fileName } )<DD>





Make a new, empty zip archive.


<P>




<PRE>
    my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();

</PRE>




<P>


If an additional argument is passed, <B>new()</B> will call <B>read()</B>
to read the contents of an archive:


<P>




<PRE>
    my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new( 'xyz.zip' );

</PRE>




<P>


If a filename argument is passed and the read fails for any
reason, new will return undef. For this reason, it may be
better to call read separately.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Zip Archive Utility Methods</H3>



These Archive::Zip methods may be called as functions or as object
methods. Do not call them as class methods:
<P>



<PRE>
    $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();
    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( 'ghijkl' );    # OK
    $crc = $zip-&gt;computeCRC32( 'ghijkl' );            # also OK
    $crc = Archive::Zip-&gt;computeCRC32( 'ghijkl' );    # NOT OK

</PRE>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="20">Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( $string [, $crc] )<DD>





<DT id="21">Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( { string =&gt; $string [, checksum =&gt; $crc ] } )<DD>





This is a utility function that uses the Compress::Raw::Zlib <FONT SIZE="-1">CRC</FONT>
routine to compute a <FONT SIZE="-1">CRC-32.</FONT> You can get the <FONT SIZE="-1">CRC</FONT> of a string:


<P>




<PRE>
    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( $string );

</PRE>




<P>


Or you can compute the running <FONT SIZE="-1">CRC:</FONT>


<P>




<PRE>
    $crc = 0;
    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( 'abcdef', $crc );
    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( 'ghijkl', $crc );

</PRE>


<DT id="22">Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( $number )<DD>





<DT id="23">Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( { chunkSize =&gt; $number } )<DD>





Report or change chunk size used for reading and writing.
This can make big differences in dealing with large files.
Currently, this defaults to 32K. This also changes the chunk
size used for Compress::Raw::Zlib. You must call <B>setChunkSize()</B>
before reading or writing. This is not exportable, so you
must call it like:


<P>




<PRE>
    Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( 4096 );

</PRE>




<P>


or as a method on a zip (though this is a global setting).
Returns old chunk size.
<DT id="24"><B>Archive::Zip::chunkSize()</B><DD>


Returns the current chunk size:


<P>




<PRE>
    my $chunkSize = Archive::Zip::chunkSize();

</PRE>


<DT id="25">Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( \&amp;subroutine )<DD>



<DT id="26">Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( { subroutine =&gt; \&amp;subroutine } )<DD>



Change the subroutine called with error strings. This
defaults to \&amp;Carp::carp, but you may want to change it to
get the error strings. This is not exportable, so you must
call it like:


<P>




<PRE>
    Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( \&amp;myErrorHandler );

</PRE>




<P>


If myErrorHandler is undef, resets handler to default.
Returns old error handler. Note that if you call Carp::carp
or a similar routine or if you're chaining to the default
error handler from your error handler, you may want to
increment the number of caller levels that are skipped (do
not just set it to a number):


<P>




<PRE>
    $Carp::CarpLevel++;

</PRE>


<DT id="27">Archive::Zip::tempFile( [ $tmpdir ] )<DD>





<DT id="28">Archive::Zip::tempFile( { tempDir =&gt; $tmpdir } )<DD>





Create a uniquely named temp file. It will be returned open
for read/write. If <TT>$tmpdir</TT> is given, it is used as the
name of a directory to create the file in. If not given,
creates the file using <TT>&quot;File::Spec::tmpdir()&quot;</TT>. Generally, you can
override this choice using the


<P>




<PRE>
    $ENV{TMPDIR}

</PRE>




<P>


environment variable. But see the File::Spec
documentation for your system. Note that on many systems, if you're
running in taint mode, then you must make sure that <TT>$ENV{TMPDIR}</TT> is
untainted for it to be used.
Will <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>NOT</I></FONT><I></I> create <TT>$tmpdir</TT> if it does not exist (this is a change
from prior versions!). Returns file handle and name:


<P>




<PRE>
    my ($fh, $name) = Archive::Zip::tempFile();
    my ($fh, $name) = Archive::Zip::tempFile('myTempDir');
    my $fh = Archive::Zip::tempFile();  # if you don't need the name

</PRE>


</DL>

</PRE>


<DT id="30"><B>numberOfMembers()</B><DD>


Return the number of members I have
<DT id="31"><B>memberNames()</B><DD>

undef. <TT>$string</TT> must be in Zip (Unix) filename format.
<DT id="34">membersMatching( $regex )<DD>





<DT id="35">membersMatching( { regex =&gt; $regex } )<DD>





Return array of members whose filenames match given regular
expression in list context. Returns number of matching

    # or
    my $numberOfTextFiles = $zip-&gt;membersMatching( '.*\.txt' );

</PRE>


<DT id="36"><B>zip64()</B><DD>


Returns whether the previous read or write of the archive has
been done in zip64 format.
<DT id="37"><B>desiredZip64Mode()</B><DD>


Gets or sets which parts of the archive should be written in
zip64 format: All parts as needed (<FONT SIZE="-1">ZIP64_AS_NEEDED</FONT>), the default,
force writing the zip64 end of central directory record
(<FONT SIZE="-1">ZIP64_EOCD</FONT>), force writing the zip64 <FONT SIZE="-1">EOCD</FONT> record and all headers
in zip64 format (<FONT SIZE="-1">ZIP64_HEADERS</FONT>).
<DT id="38"><B>versionMadeBy()</B><DD>



<DT id="39"><B>versionNeededToExtract()</B><DD>



Gets the fields from the zip64 end of central directory
record. These are always 0 if the archive is not in zip64 format.
<DT id="40"><B>diskNumber()</B><DD>


Return the disk that I start on. Not used for writing zips,
but might be interesting if you read a zip in. This should be
0, as Archive::Zip does not handle multi-volume archives.
<DT id="41"><B>diskNumberWithStartOfCentralDirectory()</B><DD>


Return the disk number that holds the beginning of the
central directory. Not used for writing zips, but might be
interesting if you read a zip in. This should be 0, as
Archive::Zip does not handle multi-volume archives.
<DT id="42"><B>numberOfCentralDirectoriesOnThisDisk()</B><DD>


Return the number of <FONT SIZE="-1">CD</FONT> structures in the zipfile last read in.
Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip
in.
<DT id="43"><B>numberOfCentralDirectories()</B><DD>


Return the number of <FONT SIZE="-1">CD</FONT> structures in the zipfile last read in.
Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip
in.
<DT id="44"><B>centralDirectorySize()</B><DD>


Returns central directory size, as read from an external zip
file. Not used for writing zips, but might be interesting if
you read a zip in.
<DT id="45"><B>centralDirectoryOffsetWRTStartingDiskNumber()</B><DD>


Returns the offset into the zip file where the <FONT SIZE="-1">CD</FONT> begins. Not
used for writing zips, but might be interesting if you read a
zip in.
<DT id="46">zipfileComment( [ $string ] )<DD>





<DT id="47">zipfileComment( [ { comment =&gt; $string } ] )<DD>





Get or set the zipfile comment. Returns the old comment.


<P>




<PRE>
    print $zip-&gt;zipfileComment();
    $zip-&gt;zipfileComment( 'New Comment' );

</PRE>


<DT id="48"><B>eocdOffset()</B><DD>


Returns the (unexpected) number of bytes between where the
<FONT SIZE="-1">EOCD</FONT> was found and where it expected to be. This is normally
0, but would be positive if something (a virus, perhaps) had
added bytes somewhere before the <FONT SIZE="-1">EOCD.</FONT> Not used for writing
zips, but might be interesting if you read a zip in. Here is
an example of how you can diagnose this:


<P>




<PRE>
  my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new('somefile.zip');
  if ($zip-&gt;eocdOffset())
  {
    warn &quot;A virus has added &quot;, $zip-&gt;eocdOffset, &quot; bytes of garbage\n&quot;;
  }

</PRE>




<P>


The <TT>&quot;eocdOffset()&quot;</TT> is used to adjust the starting position of member
headers, if necessary.
<DT id="49"><B>fileName()</B><DD>


Returns the name of the file last read from. If nothing has
been read yet, returns an empty string; if read from a file
handle, returns the handle in string form.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Zip Archive Member Operations</H3>



Various operations on a zip file modify members. When a member is
passed as an argument, you can either use a reference to the member
itself, or the name of a member. Of course, using the name requires
that names be unique within a zip (this is not enforced).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="50">removeMember( $memberOrName )<DD>





<DT id="51">removeMember( { memberOrZipName =&gt; $memberOrName } )<DD>





Remove and return the given member, or match its name and
remove it. Returns undef if member or name does not exist in this
Zip. No-op if member does not belong to this zip.
<DT id="52">replaceMember( $memberOrName, $newMember )<DD>





<DT id="53">replaceMember( { memberOrZipName =&gt; $memberOrName, newMember =&gt; $newMember } )<DD>





Remove and return the given member, or match its name and
remove it. Replace with new member. Returns undef if member or
name does not exist in this Zip, or if <TT>$newMember</TT> is undefined.


<P>


It is an (undiagnosed) error to provide a <TT>$newMember</TT> that is a
member of the zip being modified.


<P>




<PRE>
    my $member1 = $zip-&gt;removeMember( 'xyz' );
    my $member2 = $zip-&gt;replaceMember( 'abc', $member1 );
    # now, $member2 (named 'abc') is not in $zip,
    # and $member1 (named 'xyz') is, having taken $member2's place.

</PRE>


<DT id="54">extractMember( $memberOrName [, $extractedName ] )<DD>





<DT id="55">extractMember( { memberOrZipName =&gt; $memberOrName [, name =&gt; $extractedName ] } )<DD>





Extract the given member, or match its name and extract it.
Returns undef if member does not exist in this Zip. If
optional second arg is given, use it as the name of the
extracted member. Otherwise, the internal filename of the
member is used as the name of the extracted file or
directory.
If you pass <TT>$extractedName</TT>, it should be in the local file
system's format.
If you do not pass <TT>$extractedName</TT> and the internal filename traverses
a parent directory or a symbolic link, the extraction will be aborted with
<TT>&quot;AC_ERROR&quot;</TT> for security reason.
All necessary directories will be created. Returns <TT>&quot;AZ_OK&quot;</TT>
on success.
<DT id="56">extractMemberWithoutPaths( $memberOrName [, $extractedName ] )<DD>





<DT id="57">extractMemberWithoutPaths( { memberOrZipName =&gt; $memberOrName [, name =&gt; $extractedName ] } )<DD>





Extract the given member, or match its name and extract it.
Does not use path information (extracts into the current
directory). Returns undef if member does not exist in this
Zip.
If optional second arg is given, use it as the name of the
extracted member (its paths will be deleted too). Otherwise,
the internal filename of the member (minus paths) is used as
the name of the extracted file or directory. Returns <TT>&quot;AZ_OK&quot;</TT>
on success.
If you do not pass <TT>$extractedName</TT> and the internal filename is equalled
to a local symbolic link, the extraction will be aborted with <TT>&quot;AC_ERROR&quot;</TT> for
security reason.
<DT id="58">addMember( $member )<DD>





<DT id="59">addMember( { member =&gt; $member } )<DD>





Append a member (possibly from another zip file) to the zip
file. Returns the new member. Generally, you will use
<B>addFile()</B>, <B>addDirectory()</B>, <B>addFileOrDirectory()</B>, <B>addString()</B>,
or <B>read()</B> to add members.


<P>




<PRE>
    # Move member named 'abc' to end of zip:
    my $member = $zip-&gt;removeMember( 'abc' );
    $zip-&gt;addMember( $member );

</PRE>


<DT id="60">updateMember( $memberOrName, $fileName )<DD>





<DT id="61">updateMember( { memberOrZipName =&gt; $memberOrName, name =&gt; $fileName } )<DD>





Update a single member from the file or directory named <TT>$fileName</TT>.
Returns the (possibly added or updated) member, if any; <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> on
errors.
The comparison is based on <TT>&quot;lastModTime()&quot;</TT> and (in the case of a
non-directory) the size of the file.
<DT id="62">addFile( $fileName [, $newName, $compressionLevel ] )<DD>





<DT id="63">addFile( { filename =&gt; $fileName [, zipName =&gt; $newName, compressionLevel =&gt; $compressionLevel } ] )<DD>





Append a member whose data comes from an external file,
returning the member or undef. The member will have its file
name set to the name of the external file, and its
desiredCompressionMethod set to <FONT SIZE="-1">COMPRESSION_DEFLATED.</FONT> The
file attributes and last modification time will be set from
the file.
If the name given does not represent a readable plain file or
symbolic link, undef will be returned. <TT>$fileName</TT> must be
in the format required for the local file system.
The optional <TT>$newName</TT> argument sets the internal file name
to something different than the given <TT>$fileName</TT>. <TT>$newName</TT>,
if given, must be in Zip name format (i.e. Unix).
The text mode bit will be set if the contents appears to be
text (as returned by the <TT>&quot;-T&quot;</TT> perl operator).

<I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>NOTE</I></FONT><I></I> that you should not (generally) use absolute path names

<DT id="64">addDirectory( $directoryName [, $fileName ] )<DD>





<DT id="65">addDirectory( { directoryName =&gt; $directoryName [, zipName =&gt; $fileName ] } )<DD>





Append a member created from the given directory name. The
directory name does not have to name an existing directory.
If the named directory exists, the file modification time and
permissions are set from the existing directory, otherwise
they are set to now and permissive default permissions.
<TT>$directoryName</TT> must be in local file system format.
The optional second argument sets the name of the archive
member (which defaults to <TT>$directoryName</TT>). If given, it
must be in Zip (Unix) format.
Returns the new member.
<DT id="66">addFileOrDirectory( $name [, $newName, $compressionLevel ] )<DD>





<DT id="67">addFileOrDirectory( { name =&gt; $name [, zipName =&gt; $newName, compressionLevel =&gt; $compressionLevel ] } )<DD>





Append a member from the file or directory named <TT>$name</TT>. If
<TT>$newName</TT> is given, use it for the name of the new member.
Will add or remove trailing slashes from <TT>$newName</TT> as needed.
<TT>$name</TT> must be in local file system format.
The optional second argument sets the name of the archive
member (which defaults to <TT>$name</TT>). If given, it must be in
Zip (Unix) format.
<DT id="68">addString( $stringOrStringRef, $name, [$compressionLevel] )<DD>





<DT id="69">addString( { string =&gt; $stringOrStringRef [, zipName =&gt; $name, compressionLevel =&gt; $compressionLevel ] } )<DD>





Append a member created from the given string or string
reference. The name is given by the second argument.
Returns the new member. The last modification time will be
set to now, and the file attributes will be set to permissive
defaults.


<P>




<PRE>
    my $member = $zip-&gt;addString( 'This is a test', 'test.txt' );

<DT id="70">contents( $memberOrMemberName [, $newContents ] )<DD>





<DT id="71">contents( { memberOrZipName =&gt; $memberOrMemberName [, contents =&gt; $newContents ] } )<DD>





Returns the uncompressed data for a particular member, or
undef.


<P>




<PRE>
    print &quot;xyz.txt contains &quot; . $zip-&gt;contents( 'xyz.txt' );

</PRE>




<P>


Also can change the contents of a member:


<P>




<PRE>
    $zip-&gt;contents( 'xyz.txt', 'This is the new contents' );

</PRE>




<P>


If called expecting an array as the return value, it will include
the status as the second value in the array.

<H3>Zip Archive I/O operations</H3>



A Zip archive can be written to a file or file handle, or read from
one.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="72">writeToFileNamed( $fileName )<DD>





<DT id="73">writeToFileNamed( { fileName =&gt; $fileName } )<DD>





Write a zip archive to named file. Returns <TT>&quot;AZ_OK&quot;</TT> on
success.


<P>




<PRE>
    my $status = $zip-&gt;writeToFileNamed( 'xx.zip' );
    die &quot;error somewhere&quot; if $status != AZ_OK;

</PRE>




<P>


Note that if you use the same name as an existing zip file
that you read in, you will clobber ZipFileMembers. So
instead, write to a different file name, then delete the
original.
If you use the <TT>&quot;overwrite()&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;overwriteAs()&quot;</TT> methods, you can
re-write the original zip in this way.
<TT>$fileName</TT> should be a valid file name on your system.
<DT id="74">writeToFileHandle( $fileHandle [, $seekable] )<DD>




Write a zip archive to a file handle. Return <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> on
success. The optional second arg tells whether or not to try
to seek backwards to re-write headers. If not provided, it is
set if the Perl <TT>&quot;-f&quot;</TT> test returns true. This could fail on
some operating systems, though.


<P>




<PRE>
    my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( 'someFile.zip', 'w' );
    unless ( $zip-&gt;writeToFileHandle( $fh ) == AZ_OK ) {
        # error handling
    }

</PRE>




<P>


If you pass a file handle that is not seekable (like if
you're writing to a pipe or a socket), pass a false second
argument:


<P>




<PRE>
    my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( '| cat &gt; somefile.zip', 'w' );
    $zip-&gt;writeToFileHandle( $fh, 0 );   # fh is not seekable

</PRE>




<P>


If this method fails during the write of a member, that
member and all following it will return false from
<TT>&quot;wasWritten()&quot;</TT>. See <B>writeCentralDirectory()</B> for a way to
deal with this.
If you want, you can write data to the file handle before
passing it to <B>writeToFileHandle()</B>; this could be used (for
instance) for making self-extracting archives. However, this
only works reliably when writing to a real file (as opposed
to <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT> or some other possible non-file).


<P>


See examples/selfex.pl for how to write a self-extracting
archive.
<DT id="75">writeCentralDirectory( $fileHandle [, $offset ] )<DD>





<DT id="76">writeCentralDirectory( { fileHandle =&gt; $fileHandle [, offset =&gt; $offset ] } )<DD>





Writes the central directory structure to the given file
handle.


<P>


Returns <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> on success. If given an <TT>$offset</TT>, will
seek to that point before writing. This can be used for
recovery in cases where writeToFileHandle or writeToFileNamed
returns an <FONT SIZE="-1">IO</FONT> error because of running out of space on the
destination file.


<P>


You can truncate the zip by seeking backwards and then writing the
directory:


<P>




<PRE>
    my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( 'someFile.zip', 'w' );
        my $retval = $zip-&gt;writeToFileHandle( $fh );
    if ( $retval == AZ_IO_ERROR ) {
        my @unwritten = grep { not $_-&gt;wasWritten() } $zip-&gt;members();
        if (@unwritten) {
            $zip-&gt;removeMember( $member ) foreach my $member ( @unwritten );
            $zip-&gt;writeCentralDirectory( $fh,
            $unwritten[0]-&gt;writeLocalHeaderRelativeOffset());
        }
    }

</PRE>


<DT id="77">overwriteAs( $newName )<DD>





<DT id="78">overwriteAs( { filename =&gt; $newName } )<DD>





Write the zip to the specified file, as safely as possible.
This is done by first writing to a temp file, then renaming
the original if it exists, then renaming the temp file, then
deleting the renamed original if it exists. Returns <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> if
successful.
<DT id="79"><B>overwrite()</B><DD>


Write back to the original zip file. See <B>overwriteAs()</B> above.
If the zip was not ever read from a file, this generates an
error.
<DT id="80">read( $fileName )<DD>





<DT id="81">read( { filename =&gt; $fileName } )<DD>





Read zipfile headers from a zip file, appending new members.

    my $zipFile = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();
    my $status = $zipFile-&gt;read( '/some/FileName.zip' );

<DT id="82">readFromFileHandle( $fileHandle, $filename )<DD>





<DT id="83">readFromFileHandle( { fileHandle =&gt; $fileHandle, filename =&gt; $filename } )<DD>





Read zipfile headers from an already-opened file handle,
appending new members. Does not close the file handle.
Returns <TT>&quot;AZ_OK&quot;</TT> or error code. Note that this requires a
seekable file handle; reading from a stream is not yet
supported, but using in-memory data is.


<P>




<PRE>
    my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( '/some/FileName.zip', 'r' );

<DT id="85">$zip-&gt;addTree( { root =&gt; $root, zipName =&gt; $dest [, select =&gt; $pred, compressionLevel =&gt; $compressionLevel ] )<DD>





<TT>$root</TT> is the root of the tree of files and directories to be
added. It is a valid directory name on your system. <TT>$dest</TT> is
the name for the root in the zip file (undef or blank means
to use relative pathnames). It is a valid <FONT SIZE="-1">ZIP</FONT> directory name
(that is, it uses forward slashes (/) for separating
directory components). <TT>$pred</TT> is an optional subroutine
reference to select files: it is passed the name of the
prospective file or directory using <TT>$_</TT>, and if it returns
true, the file or directory will be included. The default is
to add all readable files and directories. For instance,
using


<P>




<PRE>
  my $pred = sub { /\.txt/ };
  $zip-&gt;addTree( '.', '', $pred );

</PRE>




<P>


will add all the .txt files in and below the current

identical in the zipfile:


<P>




<PRE>
  original name           zip member name
  ./xyz                   xyz
  ./a/                    a/
  ./a/b                   a/b

</PRE>

<DT id="87">$zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( { root =&gt; $root, zipName =&gt; $dest, pattern =&gt; $pattern [, select =&gt; $pred, compressionLevel =&gt; $compressionLevel ] } )<DD>





<TT>$root</TT> is the root of the tree of files and directories to be

<DT id="89">$zip-&gt;updateTree( { root =&gt; $root [, zipName =&gt; $dest, select =&gt; $pred, mirror =&gt; $mirror, compressionLevel =&gt; $compressionLevel ] } );<DD>





Update a zip file from a directory tree.


<P>


<TT>&quot;updateTree()&quot;</TT> takes the same arguments as <TT>&quot;addTree()&quot;</TT>, but first
checks to see whether the file or directory already exists in the zip
file, and whether it has been changed.


<P>


If the fourth argument <TT>$mirror</TT> is true, then delete all my members
if corresponding files were not found.

<DT id="91">$zip-&gt;extractTree( [ { root =&gt; $root, zipName =&gt; $dest, volume =&gt; $volume } ] )<DD>





If you don't give any arguments at all, will extract all the
files in the zip with their original names.


<P>


If you supply one argument for <TT>$root</TT>, <TT>&quot;extractTree&quot;</TT> will extract
all the members whose names start with <TT>$root</TT> into the current
directory, stripping off <TT>$root</TT> first.
<TT>$root</TT> is in Zip (Unix) format.
For instance,


<P>




<PRE>
  $zip-&gt;extractTree( 'a' );

</PRE>




<P>


when applied to a zip containing the files:
a/x a/b/c ax/d/e d/e will extract:


<P>


a/x as ./x


<P>


a/b/c as ./b/c


<P>


If you give two arguments, <TT>&quot;extractTree&quot;</TT> extracts all the members
whose names start with <TT>$root</TT>. It will translate <TT>$root</TT> into
<TT>$dest</TT> to construct the destination file name.
<TT>$root</TT> and <TT>$dest</TT> are in Zip (Unix) format.
For instance,


<P>




<PRE>
   $zip-&gt;extractTree( 'a', 'd/e' );

</PRE>




<P>


when applied to a zip containing the files:
a/x a/b/c ax/d/e d/e will extract:


<P>


a/x to d/e/x


<P>


a/b/c to d/e/b/c and ignore ax/d/e and d/e


<P>


If you give three arguments, <TT>&quot;extractTree&quot;</TT> extracts all the members
whose names start with <TT>$root</TT>. It will translate <TT>$root</TT> into
<TT>$dest</TT> to construct the destination file name, and then it will
convert to local file system format, using <TT>$volume</TT> as the name of
the destination volume.


<P>


<TT>$root</TT> and <TT>$dest</TT> are in Zip (Unix) format.


<P>


<TT>$volume</TT> is in local file system format.


<P>


For instance, under Windows,


<P>




<PRE>
   $zip-&gt;extractTree( 'a', 'd/e', 'f:' );

</PRE>




<P>


when applied to a zip containing the files:
a/x a/b/c ax/d/e d/e will extract:


<P>


a/x to f:d/e/x


<P>


a/b/c to f:d/e/b/c and ignore ax/d/e and d/e


<P>


If you want absolute paths (the prior example used paths relative to
the current directory on the destination volume, you can specify these
in <TT>$dest</TT>:


<P>




<PRE>
   $zip-&gt;extractTree( 'a', '/d/e', 'f:' );

</PRE>




<P>


when applied to a zip containing the files:
a/x a/b/c ax/d/e d/e will extract:


<P>


a/x to f:\d\e\x


<P>


a/b/c to f:\d\e\b\c and ignore ax/d/e and d/e


<P>


If the path to the extracted file traverses a parent directory or a symbolic
link, the extraction will be aborted with <TT>&quot;AC_ERROR&quot;</TT> for security reason.

Note that the return value has more than just the file
permissions, so you will have to mask off the lowest bits for
comparisons.
<DT id="120">localExtraField( [ $newField ] )<DD>





<DT id="121">localExtraField( [ { field =&gt; $newField } ] )<DD>





Gets or sets the extra field that was read from the local
header. The extra field must be in the proper format.  If it is
not or if the new field contains data related to the zip64
format, this method does not modify the extra field and returns
<FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_FORMAT_ERROR,</FONT> otherwise it returns <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK.</FONT>
<DT id="122">cdExtraField( [ $newField ] )<DD>





<DT id="123">cdExtraField( [ { field =&gt; $newField } ] )<DD>





Gets or sets the extra field that was read from the central
directory header. The extra field must be in the proper format.
If it is not or if the new field contains data related to the
zip64 format, this method does not modify the extra field and
returns <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_FORMAT_ERROR,</FONT> otherwise it returns <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK.</FONT>
<DT id="124"><B>extraFields()</B><DD>


Return both local and <FONT SIZE="-1">CD</FONT> extra fields, concatenated.
<DT id="125">fileComment( [ $newComment ] )<DD>





<DT id="126">fileComment( [ { comment =&gt; $newComment } ] )<DD>





Get or set the member's file comment.
<DT id="127"><B>hasDataDescriptor()</B><DD>


Get or set the data descriptor flag. If this is set, the
local header will not necessarily have the correct data
sizes. Instead, a small structure will be stored at the end
of the member data with these values. This should be
transparent in normal operation.
<DT id="128"><B>crc32()</B><DD>


Return the <FONT SIZE="-1">CRC-32</FONT> value for this member. This will not be set
for members that were constructed from strings or external
files until after the member has been written.
<DT id="129"><B>crc32String()</B><DD>


Return the <FONT SIZE="-1">CRC-32</FONT> value for this member as an 8 character
printable hex string. This will not be set for members that
were constructed from strings or external files until after
the member has been written.
<DT id="130"><B>compressedSize()</B><DD>


Return the compressed size for this member. This will not be
set for members that were constructed from strings or
external files until after the member has been written.
<DT id="131"><B>uncompressedSize()</B><DD>


Return the uncompressed size for this member.
<DT id="132">password( [ $password ] )<DD>




Returns the password for this member to be used on decryption.
If <TT>$password</TT> is given, it will set the password for the decryption.
<DT id="133"><B>isEncrypted()</B><DD>


Return true if this member is encrypted. The Archive::Zip
module does not currently support creation of encrypted
members. Decryption works more or less like this:


<P>




<PRE>
  my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new;
  $zip-&gt;read (&quot;encrypted.zip&quot;);
  for my $m (map { $zip-&gt;memberNamed ($_) } $zip-&gt;memberNames) {
      $m-&gt;password (&quot;secret&quot;);
      $m-&gt;contents;  # is &quot;&quot; when password was wrong

</PRE>




<P>


That shows that the password has to be set per member, and not per
archive. This might change in the future.
<DT id="134">isTextFile( [ $flag ] )<DD>





<DT id="135">isTextFile( [ { flag =&gt; $flag } ] )<DD>





Returns true if I am a text file. Also can set the status if
given an argument (then returns old state). Note that this
module does not currently do anything with this flag upon
extraction or storage. That is, bytes are stored in native
format whether or not they came from a text file.
<DT id="136"><B>isBinaryFile()</B><DD>


Returns true if I am a binary file. Also can set the status
if given an argument (then returns old state). Note that this
module does not currently do anything with this flag upon
extraction or storage. That is, bytes are stored in native
format whether or not they came from a text file.
<DT id="137">extractToFileNamed( $fileName )<DD>





<DT id="138">extractToFileNamed( { name =&gt; $fileName } )<DD>





Extract me to a file with the given name. The file will be
created with default modes. Directories will be created as
needed.
The <TT>$fileName</TT> argument should be a valid file name on your
file system.
Returns <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> on success.
<DT id="139"><B>isDirectory()</B><DD>


Returns true if I am a directory.
<DT id="140"><B>writeLocalHeaderRelativeOffset()</B><DD>


Returns the file offset in bytes the last time I was written.
<DT id="141"><B>wasWritten()</B><DD>


Returns true if I was successfully written. Reset at the
beginning of a write attempt.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Low-level member data reading</H3>



It is possible to use lower-level routines to access member data
streams, rather than the extract* methods and <B>contents()</B>. For
instance, here is how to print the uncompressed contents of a member
in chunks using these methods:
<P>



<PRE>
    my ( $member, $status, $bufferRef );
    $member = $zip-&gt;memberNamed( 'xyz.txt' );
    $member-&gt;desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
    $status = $member-&gt;rewindData();
    die &quot;error $status&quot; unless $status == AZ_OK;
    while ( ! $member-&gt;readIsDone() )
    {
    ( $bufferRef, $status ) = $member-&gt;readChunk();
    die &quot;error $status&quot;
                if $status != AZ_OK &amp;&amp; $status != AZ_STREAM_END;
    # do something with $bufferRef:
    print $$bufferRef;
    }
    $member-&gt;endRead();

</PRE>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="142">readChunk( [ $chunkSize ] )<DD>





<DT id="143">readChunk( [ { chunkSize =&gt; $chunkSize } ] )<DD>





This reads the next chunk of given size from the member's
data stream and compresses or uncompresses it as necessary,
returning a reference to the bytes read and a status. If size
argument is not given, defaults to global set by
Archive::Zip::setChunkSize. Status is <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> on success until
the last chunk, where it returns <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_STREAM_END.</FONT> Returns <TT>&quot;(
\$bytes, $status)&quot;</TT>.


<P>




<PRE>
    my ( $outRef, $status ) = $self-&gt;readChunk();
    print $$outRef if $status != AZ_OK &amp;&amp; $status != AZ_STREAM_END;

</PRE>


<DT id="144"><B>rewindData()</B><DD>


Rewind data and set up for reading data streams or writing
zip files. Can take options for <TT>&quot;inflateInit()&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;deflateInit()&quot;</TT>, but this is not likely to be necessary.
Subclass overrides should call this method. Returns <TT>&quot;AZ_OK&quot;</TT>
on success.
<DT id="145"><B>endRead()</B><DD>


Reset the read variables and free the inflater or deflater.
Must be called to close files, etc. Returns <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> on success.
<DT id="146"><B>readIsDone()</B><DD>


Return true if the read has run out of data or encountered an error.
<DT id="147"><B>contents()</B><DD>


Return the entire uncompressed member data or undef in scalar
context. When called in array context, returns <TT>&quot;( $string,
$status )&quot;</TT>; status will be <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> on success:


<P>




<PRE>
    my $string = $member-&gt;contents();
    # or
    my ( $string, $status ) = $member-&gt;contents();
    die &quot;error $status&quot; unless $status == AZ_OK;

</PRE>




<P>


Can also be used to set the contents of a member (this may
change the class of the member):


<P>




<PRE>
    $member-&gt;contents( &quot;this is my new contents&quot; );

</PRE>


<DT id="148">extractToFileHandle( $fh )<DD>





<DT id="149">extractToFileHandle( { fileHandle =&gt; $fh } )<DD>





Extract (and uncompress, if necessary) the member's contents
to the given file handle. Return <FONT SIZE="-1">AZ_OK</FONT> on success.


<P>


For members representing symbolic links, pass the name of the
symbolic link as file handle. Ensure that all directories in the
path to the symbolic link already exist.

<H2>Archive::Zip::FileMember methods</H2>



The Archive::Zip::FileMember class extends Archive::Zip::Member. It is the
base class for both ZipFileMember and NewFileMember classes. This class adds
an <TT>&quot;externalFileName&quot;</TT> and an <TT>&quot;fh&quot;</TT> member to keep track of the external
file.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="150"><B>externalFileName()</B><DD>


Return the member's external filename.
<DT id="151"><B>fh()</B><DD>


Return the member's read file handle. Automatically opens file if
necessary.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Archive::Zip::ZipFileMember methods</H2>



The Archive::Zip::ZipFileMember class represents members that have been read
from external zip files.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="152"><B>diskNumberStart()</B><DD>


Returns the disk number that the member's local header resides in.
Should be 0.
<DT id="153"><B>localHeaderRelativeOffset()</B><DD>


Returns the offset into the zip file where the member's local header
is.
<DT id="154"><B>dataOffset()</B><DD>


Returns the offset from the beginning of the zip file to the member's
data.

<H2>BUGS AND CAVEATS</H2>



<A NAME="lbBB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>When not to use Archive::Zip</H3>



If you are just going to be extracting zips (and/or other archives) you
are recommended to look at using Archive::Extract instead, as it is much
easier to use and factors out archive-specific functionality.
<A NAME="lbBC">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Zip64 Format Support</H3>



Since version 1.67 Archive::Zip supports the so-called zip64
format, which overcomes various limitations in the original zip
file format.  On some Perl interpreters, however, even version
1.67 and newer of Archive::Zip cannot support the zip64 format.
Among these are all Perl interpreters that lack 64-bit support
and those older than version 5.10.0.
<P>

Constant <TT>&quot;ZIP64_SUPPORTED&quot;</TT>, exported with tag :CONSTANTS,
equals true if Archive::Zip on the current Perl interpreter
supports the zip64 format.  If it does not and you try to read or
write an archive in zip64 format, anyway, Archive::Zip returns an
error <TT>&quot;AZ_ERROR&quot;</TT> and reports an error message along the lines of
``zip64 format not supported on this Perl interpreter''.
<A NAME="lbBD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>versionMadeBy and versionNeededToExtract</H3>





The zip64 format and the zip file format in general specify what
values to use for the <TT>&quot;versionMadeBy&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;versionNeededToExtract&quot;</TT> fields in the local file header,
central directory file header, and zip64 <FONT SIZE="-1">EOCD</FONT> record.  In
practice however, these fields seem to be more or less randomly
used by various archiver implementations.
<P>

To achieve a compromise between backward compatibility and
(whatever) standard compliance, Archive::Zip handles them as
follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="155">&bull;<DD>
For field <TT>&quot;versionMadeBy&quot;</TT>, Archive::Zip uses default value 20
(45 for the zip64 <FONT SIZE="-1">EOCD</FONT> record) or any previously read value. It
never changes that value when writing a header, even if it is
written in zip64 format, or when writing the zip64 <FONT SIZE="-1">EOCD</FONT> record.
<DT id="156">&bull;<DD>
Likewise for field <TT>&quot;versionNeededToExtract&quot;</TT>, but here
Archive::Zip forces a minimum value of 45 when writing a header
in zip64 format or the zip64 <FONT SIZE="-1">EOCD</FONT> record.
<DT id="157">&bull;<DD>
Finally, Archive::Zip never depends on the values of these fields
in any way when reading an archive from a file or file handle.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbBE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Try to avoid IO::Scalar</H3>



One of the most common ways to use Archive::Zip is to generate Zip files
in-memory. Most people use IO::Scalar for this purpose.
<P>

Unfortunately, as of 1.11 this module no longer works with IO::Scalar
as it incorrectly implements seeking.
<P>

Anybody using IO::Scalar should consider porting to IO::String,
which is smaller, lighter, and is implemented to be perfectly compatible
with regular seekable filehandles.
<P>

Support for IO::Scalar most likely will <B>not</B> be restored in the
future, as IO::Scalar itself cannot change the way it is implemented
due to back-compatibility issues.
<A NAME="lbBF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Wrong password for encrypted members</H3>



When an encrypted member is read using the wrong password, you currently
have to re-read the entire archive to try again with the correct password.
<A NAME="lbBG">&nbsp;</A>
