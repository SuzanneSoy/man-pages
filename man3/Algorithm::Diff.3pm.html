<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>



(by Mark-Jason Dominus)
<P>

I once read an article written by the authors of <TT>&quot;diff&quot;</TT>; they said
that they worked very hard on the algorithm until they found the
right one.
<P>

I think what they ended up using (and I hope someone will correct me,
because I am not very confident about this) was the `longest common
subsequence' method.  In the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT> problem, you have two sequences of
items:
<P>



<PRE>
    a b c d f g h j q z

    a b c d e f g i j k r x y z

</PRE>


<P>

and you want to find the longest sequence of items that is present in
both original sequences in the same order.  That is, you want to find
a new sequence <I>S</I> which can be obtained from the first sequence by
deleting some items, and from the second sequence by deleting other
items.  You also want <I>S</I> to be as long as possible.  In this case <I>S</I>
is
<P>



<PRE>
    a b c d f g j z

</PRE>


<P>

From there it's only a small step to get diff-like output:
<P>



<PRE>
    e   h i   k   q r x y
    +   - +   +   - + + +

</PRE>


<P>

This module solves the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT> problem.  It also includes a canned function
to generate <TT>&quot;diff&quot;</TT>-like output.
<P>

It might seem from the example above that the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT> of two sequences is
always pretty obvious, but that's not always the case, especially when
the two sequences have many repeated elements.  For example, consider
<P>



<PRE>
    a x b y c z p d q
    a b c a x b y c z

</PRE>


<P>

A naive approach might start by matching up the <TT>&quot;a&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;b&quot;</TT> that
appear at the beginning of each sequence, like this:
<P>



<PRE>
    a x b y c         z p d q
    a   b   c a b y c z

</PRE>


<P>

This finds the common subsequence <TT>&quot;a b c z&quot;</TT>.  But actually, the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT>
is <TT>&quot;a x b y c z&quot;</TT>:
<P>



<PRE>
          a x b y c z p d q
    a b c a x b y c z

</PRE>


<P>

or
<P>



<PRE>
    a       x b y c z p d q
    a b c a x b y c z

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USAGE</H2>



(See also the <FONT SIZE="-1">README</FONT> file and several example
scripts include with this module.)
<P>

This module now provides an object-oriented interface that uses less
memory and is easier to use than most of the previous procedural
interfaces.  It also still provides several exportable functions.  We'll
deal with these in ascending order of difficulty:  <TT>&quot;LCS&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;LCS_length&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;LCSidx&quot;</TT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">OO</FONT> interface, <TT>&quot;prepare&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;diff&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;sdiff&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;traverse_balanced&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>LCS</H3>





Given references to two lists of items, <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT> returns an array containing
their longest common subsequence.  In scalar context, it returns a
reference to such a list.
<P>



<PRE>
    @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2 );
    $lcsref = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2 );

</PRE>


<P>

<TT>&quot;LCS&quot;</TT> may be passed an optional third parameter; this is a <FONT SIZE="-1">CODE</FONT>
reference to a key generation function.  See ``<FONT SIZE="-1">KEY GENERATION
FUNCTIONS''</FONT>.
<P>



<PRE>
    @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, \&amp;keyGen, @args );
    $lcsref = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, \&amp;keyGen, @args );

</PRE>


<P>

Additional parameters, if any, will be passed to the key generation
routine.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>LCS_length</H3>





This is just like <TT>&quot;LCS&quot;</TT> except it only returns the length of the
longest common subsequence.  This provides a performance gain of about
9% compared to <TT>&quot;LCS&quot;</TT>.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>LCSidx</H3>





Like <TT>&quot;LCS&quot;</TT> except it returns references to two arrays.  The first array
contains the indices into <TT>@seq1</TT> where the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT> items are located.  The
second array contains the indices into <TT>@seq2</TT> where the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT> items are located.
<P>

Therefore, the following three lists will contain the same values:
<P>



<PRE>
    my( $idx1, $idx2 ) = LCSidx( \@seq1, \@seq2 );
    my @list1 = @seq1[ @$idx1 ];
    my @list2 = @seq2[ @$idx2 ];
    my @list3 = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2 );

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>new</H3>







<PRE>
    $diff = Algorithm::Diffs-&gt;new( \@seq1, \@seq2 );
    $diff = Algorithm::Diffs-&gt;new( \@seq1, \@seq2, \%opts );

</PRE>


<P>

<TT>&quot;new&quot;</TT> computes the smallest set of additions and deletions necessary
to turn the first sequence into the second and compactly records them
in the object.
<P>

You use the object to iterate over <I>hunks</I>, where each hunk represents
a contiguous section of items which should be added, deleted, replaced,
or left unchanged.
<P>

The following summary of all of the methods looks a lot like Perl code
but some of the symbols have different meanings:
<P>



<PRE>
    [ ]     Encloses optional arguments
    :       Is followed by the default value for an optional argument
    |       Separates alternate return results

</PRE>


<P>

Method summary:
<P>



<PRE>
    $obj        = Algorithm::Diff-&gt;new( \@seq1, \@seq2, [ \%opts ] );
    $pos        = $obj-&gt;Next(  [ $count : 1 ] );
    $revPos     = $obj-&gt;Prev(  [ $count : 1 ] );
    $obj        = $obj-&gt;Reset( [ $pos : 0 ] );
    $copy       = $obj-&gt;Copy(  [ $pos, [ $newBase ] ] );
    $oldBase    = $obj-&gt;Base(  [ $newBase ] );

</PRE>


<P>

Note that all of the following methods <TT>&quot;die&quot;</TT> if used on an object that
is ``reset'' (not currently pointing at any hunk).
<P>



<PRE>
    $bits       = $obj-&gt;Diff(  );
    @items|$cnt = $obj-&gt;Same(  );
    @items|$cnt = $obj-&gt;Items( $seqNum );
    @idxs |$cnt = $obj-&gt;Range( $seqNum, [ $base ] );
    $minIdx     = $obj-&gt;Min(   $seqNum, [ $base ] );
    $maxIdx     = $obj-&gt;Max(   $seqNum, [ $base ] );
    @values     = $obj-&gt;Get(   @names );

</PRE>


<P>

Passing in <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> for an optional argument is always treated the same
as if no argument were passed in.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">&quot;Next&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    $pos = $diff-&gt;Next();    # Move forward 1 hunk
    $pos = $diff-&gt;Next( 2 ); # Move forward 2 hunks
    $pos = $diff-&gt;Next(-5);  # Move backward 5 hunks

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Next&quot;</TT> moves the object to point at the next hunk.  The object starts
out ``reset'', which means it isn't pointing at any hunk.  If the object
is reset, then <TT>&quot;Next()&quot;</TT> moves to the first hunk.


<P>


<TT>&quot;Next&quot;</TT> returns a true value iff the move didn't go past the last hunk.
So <TT>Next(0)</TT> will return true iff the object is not reset.


<P>


Actually, <TT>&quot;Next&quot;</TT> returns the object's new position, which is a number
between 1 and the number of hunks (inclusive), or returns a false value.
<DT id="2">&quot;Prev&quot;<DD>




<TT>&quot;Prev($N)&quot;</TT> is almost identical to <TT>&quot;Next(-$N)&quot;</TT>; it moves to the <TT>$Nth</TT>
previous hunk.  On a 'reset' object, <TT>&quot;Prev()&quot;</TT> [and <TT>&quot;Next(-1)&quot;</TT>] move
to the last hunk.


<P>


The position returned by <TT>&quot;Prev&quot;</TT> is relative to the <I>end</I> of the
hunks; -1 for the last hunk, -2 for the second-to-last, etc.
<DT id="3">&quot;Reset&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    $diff-&gt;Reset();     # Reset the object's position
    $diff-&gt;Reset($pos); # Move to the specified hunk
    $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Reset">Reset</A>(1);    # Move to the first hunk
    $diff-&gt;Reset(-1);   # Move to the last hunk

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Reset&quot;</TT> returns the object, so, for example, you could use
<TT>&quot;$diff-&gt;Reset()-&gt;Next(-1)&quot;</TT> to get the number of hunks.
<DT id="4">&quot;Copy&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    $copy = $diff-&gt;Copy( $newPos, $newBase );

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Copy&quot;</TT> returns a copy of the object.  The copy and the original object
share most of their data, so making copies takes very little memory.
The copy maintains its own position (separate from the original), which
is the main purpose of copies.  It also maintains its own base.


<P>


By default, the copy's position starts out the same as the original
object's position.  But <TT>&quot;Copy&quot;</TT> takes an optional first argument to set the
new position, so the following three snippets are equivalent:


<P>




<PRE>
    $copy = $diff-&gt;Copy($pos);

    $copy = $diff-&gt;Copy();
    $copy-&gt;Reset($pos);

    $copy = $diff-&gt;Copy()-&gt;Reset($pos);

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Copy&quot;</TT> takes an optional second argument to set the base for
the copy.  If you wish to change the base of the copy but leave
the position the same as in the original, here are two
equivalent ways:


<P>




<PRE>
    $copy = $diff-&gt;Copy();
    $copy-&gt;Base( 0 );

    $copy = $diff-&gt;Copy(undef,0);

</PRE>




<P>


Here are two equivalent way to get a ``reset'' copy:


<P>




<PRE>
    $copy = $diff-&gt;Copy(0);

    $copy = $diff-&gt;Copy()-&gt;Reset();

</PRE>


<DT id="5">&quot;Diff&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    $bits = $obj-&gt;Diff();

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Diff&quot;</TT> returns a true value iff the current hunk contains items that are
different between the two sequences.  It actually returns one of the
follow 4 values:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="6"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="7">3<DD>


<TT>&quot;3==(1|2)&quot;</TT>.  This hunk contains items from <TT>@seq1</TT> and the items
from <TT>@seq2</TT> that should replace them.  Both sequence 1 and 2
contain changed items so both the 1 and 2 bits are set.
<DT id="8">2<DD>


This hunk only contains items from <TT>@seq2</TT> that should be inserted (not
items from <TT>@seq1</TT>).  Only sequence 2 contains changed items so only the 2
bit is set.
<DT id="9">1<DD>


This hunk only contains items from <TT>@seq1</TT> that should be deleted (not
items from <TT>@seq2</TT>).  Only sequence 1 contains changed items so only the 1
bit is set.
<DT id="10">0<DD>
This means that the items in this hunk are the same in both sequences.
Neither sequence 1 nor 2 contain changed items so neither the 1 nor the
2 bits are set.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="11"><DD>
</DL>

<DT id="12">&quot;Same&quot;<DD>




<TT>&quot;Same&quot;</TT> returns a true value iff the current hunk contains items that
are the same in both sequences.  It actually returns the list of items
if they are the same or an empty list if they aren't.  In a scalar
context, it returns the size of the list.
<DT id="13">&quot;Items&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    $count = $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+Items">Items</A>(2);
    @items = $diff-&gt;Items($seqNum);

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Items&quot;</TT> returns the (number of) items from the specified sequence that
are part of the current hunk.


<P>


If the current hunk contains only insertions, then
<TT>&quot;$diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Items">Items</A>(1)&quot;</TT> will return an empty list (0 in a scalar context).
If the current hunk contains only deletions, then <TT>&quot;$diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+Items">Items</A>(2)&quot;</TT>
will return an empty list (0 in a scalar context).


<P>


If the hunk contains replacements, then both <TT>&quot;$diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Items">Items</A>(1)&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;$diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+Items">Items</A>(2)&quot;</TT> will return different, non-empty lists.


<P>


Otherwise, the hunk contains identical items and all of the following
will return the same lists:


<P>




<PRE>
    @items = $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Items">Items</A>(1);
    @items = $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+Items">Items</A>(2);
    @items = $diff-&gt;Same();

</PRE>


<DT id="14">&quot;Range&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    $count = $diff-&gt;Range( $seqNum );
    @indices = $diff-&gt;Range( $seqNum );
    @indices = $diff-&gt;Range( $seqNum, $base );

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Range&quot;</TT> is like <TT>&quot;Items&quot;</TT> except that it returns a list of <I>indices</I> to
the items rather than the items themselves.  By default, the index of
the first item (in each sequence) is 0 but this can be changed by
calling the <TT>&quot;Base&quot;</TT> method.  So, by default, the following two snippets
return the same lists:


<P>




<PRE>
    @list = $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+Items">Items</A>(2);
    @list = @seq2[ $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+Range">Range</A>(2) ];

</PRE>




<P>


You can also specify the base to use as the second argument.  So the
following two snippets <I>always</I> return the same lists:


<P>




<PRE>
    @list = $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Items">Items</A>(1);
    @list = @seq1[ $diff-&gt;Range(1,0) ];

</PRE>


<DT id="15">&quot;Base&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    $curBase = $diff-&gt;Base();
    $oldBase = $diff-&gt;Base($newBase);

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Base&quot;</TT> sets and/or returns the current base (usually 0 or 1) that is
used when you request range information.  The base defaults to 0 so
that range information is returned as array indices.  You can set the
base to 1 if you want to report traditional line numbers instead.
<DT id="16">&quot;Min&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    $min1 = $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Min">Min</A>(1);
    $min = $diff-&gt;Min( $seqNum, $base );

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Min&quot;</TT> returns the first value that <TT>&quot;Range&quot;</TT> would return (given the
same arguments) or returns <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> if <TT>&quot;Range&quot;</TT> would return an empty
list.
<DT id="17">&quot;Max&quot;<DD>




<TT>&quot;Max&quot;</TT> returns the last value that <TT>&quot;Range&quot;</TT> would return or <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="18">&quot;Get&quot;<DD>






<PRE>
    ( $n, $x, $r ) = $diff-&gt;Get(qw( min1 max1 range1 ));
    @values = $diff-&gt;Get(qw( 0min2 1max2 range2 same base ));

</PRE>




<P>


<TT>&quot;Get&quot;</TT> returns one or more scalar values.  You pass in a list of the
names of the values you want returned.  Each name must match one of the
following regexes:


<P>




<PRE>
    /^(-?\d+)?(min|max)[12]$/i
    /^(range[12]|same|diff|base)$/i

</PRE>




<P>


The 1 or 2 after a name says which sequence you want the information
for (and where allowed, it is required).  The optional number before
``min'' or ``max'' is the base to use.  So the following equalities hold:


<P>




<PRE>
    $diff-&gt;Get('min1') == $diff-&gt;<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Min">Min</A>(1)
    $diff-&gt;Get('0min2') == $diff-&gt;Min(2,0)

</PRE>




<P>


Using <TT>&quot;Get&quot;</TT> in a scalar context when you've passed in more than one
name is a fatal error (<TT>&quot;die&quot;</TT> is called).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>prepare</H3>





Given a reference to a list of items, <TT>&quot;prepare&quot;</TT> returns a reference
to a hash which can be used when comparing this sequence to other
sequences with <TT>&quot;LCS&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;LCS_length&quot;</TT>.
<P>



<PRE>
    $prep = prepare( \@seq1 );
    for $i ( 0 .. 10_000 )
    {
        @lcs = LCS( $prep, $seq[$i] );
        # do something useful with @lcs
    }

</PRE>


<P>

<TT>&quot;prepare&quot;</TT> may be passed an optional third parameter; this is a <FONT SIZE="-1">CODE</FONT>
reference to a key generation function.  See ``<FONT SIZE="-1">KEY GENERATION
FUNCTIONS''</FONT>.
<P>



<PRE>
    $prep = prepare( \@seq1, \&amp;keyGen );
    for $i ( 0 .. 10_000 )
    {
        @lcs = LCS( $seq[$i], $prep, \&amp;keyGen );
        # do something useful with @lcs
    }

</PRE>


<P>

Using <TT>&quot;prepare&quot;</TT> provides a performance gain of about 50% when calling <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT>
many times compared with not preparing.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>diff</H3>







<PRE>
    @diffs     = diff( \@seq1, \@seq2 );
    $diffs_ref = diff( \@seq1, \@seq2 );

</PRE>


<P>

<TT>&quot;diff&quot;</TT> computes the smallest set of additions and deletions necessary
to turn the first sequence into the second, and returns a description
of these changes.  The description is a list of <I>hunks</I>; each hunk
represents a contiguous section of items which should be added,
deleted, or replaced.  (Hunks containing unchanged items are not
included.)
<P>

The return value of <TT>&quot;diff&quot;</TT> is a list of hunks, or, in scalar context, a
reference to such a list.  If there are no differences, the list will be
empty.
<P>

Here is an example.  Calling <TT>&quot;diff&quot;</TT> for the following two sequences:
<P>



<PRE>
    a b c e h j l m n p
    b c d e f j k l m r s t

</PRE>


<P>

would produce the following list:
<P>



<PRE>
    (
      [ [ '-', 0, 'a' ] ],

      [ [ '+', 2, 'd' ] ],

      [ [ '-', 4, 'h' ],
        [ '+', 4, 'f' ] ],

      [ [ '+', 6, 'k' ] ],

      [ [ '-',  8, 'n' ],
        [ '-',  9, 'p' ],
        [ '+',  9, 'r' ],
        [ '+', 10, 's' ],
        [ '+', 11, 't' ] ],
    )

</PRE>


<P>

There are five hunks here.  The first hunk says that the <TT>&quot;a&quot;</TT> at
position 0 of the first sequence should be deleted (<TT>&quot;-&quot;</TT>).  The second
hunk says that the <TT>&quot;d&quot;</TT> at position 2 of the second sequence should
be inserted (<TT>&quot;+&quot;</TT>).  The third hunk says that the <TT>&quot;h&quot;</TT> at position 4
of the first sequence should be removed and replaced with the <TT>&quot;f&quot;</TT>
from position 4 of the second sequence.  And so on.
<P>

<TT>&quot;diff&quot;</TT> may be passed an optional third parameter; this is a <FONT SIZE="-1">CODE</FONT>
reference to a key generation function.  See ``<FONT SIZE="-1">KEY GENERATION
FUNCTIONS''</FONT>.
<P>

Additional parameters, if any, will be passed to the key generation
routine.

<H3>sdiff</H3>







<PRE>
    @sdiffs     = sdiff( \@seq1, \@seq2 );
    $sdiffs_ref = sdiff( \@seq1, \@seq2 );

</PRE>


<P>

<TT>&quot;sdiff&quot;</TT> computes all necessary components to show two sequences
and their minimized differences side by side, just like the
Unix-utility <I>sdiff</I> does:
<P>



<PRE>
    same             same
    before     |     after
    old        &lt;     -
    -          &gt;     new

</PRE>


<P>

It returns a list of array refs, each pointing to an array of
display instructions. In scalar context it returns a reference
to such a list. If there are no differences, the list will have one
entry per item, each indicating that the item was unchanged.
<P>

Display instructions consist of three elements: A modifier indicator
(<TT>&quot;+&quot;</TT>: Element added, <TT>&quot;-&quot;</TT>: Element removed, <TT>&quot;u&quot;</TT>: Element unmodified,
<TT>&quot;c&quot;</TT>: Element changed) and the value of the old and new elements, to
be displayed side-by-side.
<P>

An <TT>&quot;sdiff&quot;</TT> of the following two sequences:
<P>



<PRE>
    a b c e h j l m n p
    b c d e f j k l m r s t

<P>

results in

<H3>compact_diff</H3>





<TT>&quot;compact_diff&quot;</TT> is much like <TT>&quot;sdiff&quot;</TT> except it returns a much more
compact description consisting of just one flat list of indices.  An
example helps explain the format:
<P>



<PRE>
    my @a = qw( a b c   e  h j   l m n p      );
    my @b = qw(   b c d e f  j k l m    r s t );
    @cdiff = compact_diff( \@a, \@b );
    # Returns:
    #   @a      @b       @a       @b
    #  start   start   values   values
    (    0,      0,   #       =
         0,      0,   #    a  !
         1,      0,   #  b c  =  b c
         3,      2,   #       !  d
         3,      3,   #    e  =  e
         4,      4,   #    f  !  h
         5,      5,   #    j  =  j
         6,      6,   #       !  k
         6,      7,   #  l m  =  l m
         8,      9,   #  n p  !  r s t
        10,     12,   #
    );

</PRE>


<P>

The 0th, 2nd, 4th, etc. entries are all indices into <TT>@seq1</TT> (@a in the
above example) indicating where a hunk begins.  The 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.
entries are all indices into <TT>@seq2</TT> (@b in the above example) indicating
where the same hunk begins.
<P>

So each pair of indices (except the last pair) describes where a hunk
begins (in each sequence).  Since each hunk must end at the item just
before the item that starts the next hunk, the next pair of indices can
be used to determine where the hunk ends.
<P>

So, the first 4 entries (0..3) describe the first hunk.  Entries 0 and 1
describe where the first hunk begins (and so are always both 0).
Entries 2 and 3 describe where the next hunk begins, so subtracting 1
from each tells us where the first hunk ends.  That is, the first hunk
contains items <TT>$diff[0]</TT> through <TT>&quot;$diff[2] - 1&quot;</TT> of the first sequence
and contains items <TT>$diff[1]</TT> through <TT>&quot;$diff[3] - 1&quot;</TT> of the second
sequence.
<P>

In other words, the first hunk consists of the following two lists of items:
<P>



<PRE>
               #  1st pair     2nd pair
               # of indices   of indices
    @list1 = @a[ $cdiff[0] .. $cdiff[2]-1 ];
    @list2 = @b[ $cdiff[1] .. $cdiff[3]-1 ];
               # Hunk start   Hunk end

</PRE>


<P>

Note that the hunks will always alternate between those that are part of
the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS</FONT> (those that contain unchanged items) and those that contain
changes.  This means that all we need to be told is whether the first
hunk is a 'same' or 'diff' hunk and we can determine which of the other
hunks contain 'same' items or 'diff' items.
<P>

By convention, we always make the first hunk contain unchanged items.
So the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. hunks (all odd-numbered hunks if you start
counting from 1) all contain unchanged items.  And the 2nd, 4th, 6th,
etc. hunks (all even-numbered hunks if you start counting from 1) all
contain changed items.
<P>

Since <TT>@a</TT> and <TT>@b</TT> don't begin with the same value, the first hunk in our
example is empty (otherwise we'd violate the above convention).  Note
that the first 4 index values in our example are all zero.  Plug these
values into our previous code block and we get:
<P>



<PRE>
    @hunk1a = @a[ 0 .. 0-1 ];
    @hunk1b = @b[ 0 .. 0-1 ];

</PRE>


<P>

And <TT>&quot;0..-1&quot;</TT> returns the empty list.
<P>

Move down one pair of indices (2..5) and we get the offset ranges for
the second hunk, which contains changed items.
<P>

Since <TT>@diff[2..5]</TT> contains (0,0,1,0) in our example, the second hunk
consists of these two lists of items:
<P>



<PRE>
        @hunk2a = @a[ $cdiff[2] .. $cdiff[4]-1 ];
        @hunk2b = @b[ $cdiff[3] .. $cdiff[5]-1 ];
    # or
        @hunk2a = @a[ 0 .. 1-1 ];
        @hunk2b = @b[ 0 .. 0-1 ];
    # or
        @hunk2a = @a[ 0 .. 0 ];
        @hunk2b = @b[ 0 .. -1 ];
    # or
        @hunk2a = ( 'a' );
        @hunk2b = ( );

</PRE>


<P>

That is, we would delete item 0 ('a') from <TT>@a</TT>.
<P>

Since <TT>@diff[4..7]</TT> contains (1,0,3,2) in our example, the third hunk
consists of these two lists of items:
<P>



<PRE>
        @hunk3a = @a[ $cdiff[4] .. $cdiff[6]-1 ];
        @hunk3a = @b[ $cdiff[5] .. $cdiff[7]-1 ];
    # or
        @hunk3a = @a[ 1 .. 3-1 ];
        @hunk3a = @b[ 0 .. 2-1 ];
    # or
        @hunk3a = @a[ 1 .. 2 ];
        @hunk3a = @b[ 0 .. 1 ];
    # or
        @hunk3a = qw( b c );
        @hunk3a = qw( b c );

</PRE>


<P>

Note that this third hunk contains unchanged items as our convention demands.
<P>

You can continue this process until you reach the last two indices,
which will always be the number of items in each sequence.  This is
required so that subtracting one from each will give you the indices to
the last items in each sequence.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>traverse_sequences</H3>





<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> used to be the most general facility provided by
this module (the new <FONT SIZE="-1">OO</FONT> interface is more powerful and much easier to
use).
<P>

Imagine that there are two arrows.  Arrow A points to an element of
sequence A, and arrow B points to an element of the sequence B. 
Initially, the arrows point to the first elements of the respective
sequences.  <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> will advance the arrows through the
sequences one element at a time, calling an appropriate user-specified
callback function before each advance.  It will advance the arrows in
such a way that if there are equal elements <TT>$A[$i]</TT> and <TT>$B[$j]</TT>
which are equal and which are part of the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS,</FONT> there will be some moment
during the execution of <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> when arrow A is pointing
to <TT>$A[$i]</TT> and arrow B is pointing to <TT>$B[$j]</TT>.  When this happens,
<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> will call the <TT>&quot;MATCH&quot;</TT> callback function and then
it will advance both arrows.
<P>

Otherwise, one of the arrows is pointing to an element of its sequence
that is not part of the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS.</FONT>  <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> will advance that
arrow and will call the <TT>&quot;DISCARD_A&quot;</TT> or the <TT>&quot;DISCARD_B&quot;</TT> callback,
depending on which arrow it advanced.  If both arrows point to elements
that are not part of the <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS,</FONT> then <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> will advance
one of them and call the appropriate callback, but it is not specified
which it will call.
<P>

The arguments to <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> are the two sequences to
traverse, and a hash which specifies the callback functions, like this:
<P>



<PRE>
    traverse_sequences(
        \@seq1, \@seq2,
        {   MATCH =&gt; $callback_1,
            DISCARD_A =&gt; $callback_2,
            DISCARD_B =&gt; $callback_3,
        }
    );

</PRE>


<P>

Callbacks for <FONT SIZE="-1">MATCH, DISCARD_A,</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">DISCARD_B</FONT> are invoked with at least
the indices of the two arrows as their arguments.  They are not expected
to return any values.  If a callback is omitted from the table, it is
not called.
<P>

Callbacks for A_FINISHED and B_FINISHED are invoked with at least the
corresponding index in A or B.
<P>

If arrow A reaches the end of its sequence, before arrow B does,
<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> will call the <TT>&quot;A_FINISHED&quot;</TT> callback when it
advances arrow B, if there is such a function; if not it will call
<TT>&quot;DISCARD_B&quot;</TT> instead.  Similarly if arrow B finishes first. 
<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> returns when both arrows are at the ends of their
respective sequences.  It returns true on success and false on failure. 
At present there is no way to fail.
<P>

<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> may be passed an optional fourth parameter; this
is a <FONT SIZE="-1">CODE</FONT> reference to a key generation function.  See ``<FONT SIZE="-1">KEY GENERATION
FUNCTIONS''</FONT>.
<P>

Additional parameters, if any, will be passed to the key generation function.
<P>

If you want to pass additional parameters to your callbacks, but don't
need a custom key generation function, you can get the default by
passing undef:
<P>



<PRE>
    traverse_sequences(
        \@seq1, \@seq2,
        {   MATCH =&gt; $callback_1,
            DISCARD_A =&gt; $callback_2,
            DISCARD_B =&gt; $callback_3,
        },
        undef,     # default key-gen
        $myArgument1,
        $myArgument2,
        $myArgument3,
    );

</PRE>


<P>

<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> does not have a useful return value; you are
expected to plug in the appropriate behavior with the callback
functions.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>traverse_balanced</H3>





<TT>&quot;traverse_balanced&quot;</TT> is an alternative to <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT>. It
uses a different algorithm to iterate through the entries in the
computed <FONT SIZE="-1">LCS.</FONT> Instead of sticking to one side and showing element changes
as insertions and deletions only, it will jump back and forth between
the two sequences and report <I>changes</I> occurring as deletions on one
side followed immediately by an insertion on the other side.
<P>

In addition to the <TT>&quot;DISCARD_A&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;DISCARD_B&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;MATCH&quot;</TT> callbacks
supported by <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;traverse_balanced&quot;</TT> supports
a <TT>&quot;CHANGE&quot;</TT> callback indicating that one element got <TT>&quot;replaced&quot;</TT> by another:
<P>



<PRE>
    traverse_balanced(
        \@seq1, \@seq2,
        {   MATCH =&gt; $callback_1,
            DISCARD_A =&gt; $callback_2,
            DISCARD_B =&gt; $callback_3,
            CHANGE    =&gt; $callback_4,
        }
    );

</PRE>


<P>

If no <TT>&quot;CHANGE&quot;</TT> callback is specified, <TT>&quot;traverse_balanced&quot;</TT>
will map <TT>&quot;CHANGE&quot;</TT> events to <TT>&quot;DISCARD_A&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;DISCARD_B&quot;</TT> actions,
therefore resulting in a similar behaviour as <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT>
with different order of events.
<P>

<TT>&quot;traverse_balanced&quot;</TT> might be a bit slower than <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT>,
noticeable only while processing huge amounts of data.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;sdiff&quot;</TT> function of this module 
is implemented as call to <TT>&quot;traverse_balanced&quot;</TT>.
<P>

<TT>&quot;traverse_balanced&quot;</TT> does not have a useful return value; you are expected to
plug in the appropriate behavior with the callback functions.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>KEY GENERATION FUNCTIONS</H2>



Most of the functions accept an optional extra parameter.  This is a
<FONT SIZE="-1">CODE</FONT> reference to a key generating (hashing) function that should return
a string that uniquely identifies a given element.  It should be the
case that if two elements are to be considered equal, their keys should
be the same (and the other way around).  If no key generation function
is provided, the key will be the element as a string.
<P>

By default, comparisons will use ``eq'' and elements will be turned into keys
using the default stringizing operator '&quot;&quot;'.
<P>

Where this is important is when you're comparing something other than
strings.  If it is the case that you have multiple different objects
that should be considered to be equal, you should supply a key
generation function. Otherwise, you have to make sure that your arrays
contain unique references.
<P>

For instance, consider this example:
<P>



<PRE>
    package Person;

    sub new
    {
        my $package = shift;
        return bless { name =&gt; '', ssn =&gt; '', @_ }, $package;
    }

    sub clone
    {
        my $old = shift;
        my $new = bless { %$old }, ref($old);
    }

    sub hash
    {
        return shift()-&gt;{'ssn'};
    }

    my $person1 = Person-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'Joe', ssn =&gt; '123-45-6789' );
    my $person2 = Person-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'Mary', ssn =&gt; '123-47-0000' );
    my $person3 = Person-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'Pete', ssn =&gt; '999-45-2222' );
    my $person4 = Person-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'Peggy', ssn =&gt; '123-45-9999' );
    my $person5 = Person-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'Frank', ssn =&gt; '000-45-9999' );

</PRE>


<P>

If you did this:
<P>



<PRE>
    my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
    my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4, $person5 ];
    Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2 );

</PRE>


<P>

everything would work out <FONT SIZE="-1">OK</FONT> (each of the objects would be converted
into a string like ``Person=HASH(0x82425b0)'' for comparison).
<P>

But if you did this:
<P>



<PRE>
    my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
    my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4-&gt;clone(), $person5 ];
    Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2 );

</PRE>


<P>

<TT>$person4</TT> and <TT>$person4</TT>-&gt;<I>clone()</I> (which have the same name and <FONT SIZE="-1">SSN</FONT>)
would be seen as different objects. If you wanted them to be considered
equivalent, you would have to pass in a key generation function:
<P>



<PRE>
    my $array1 = [ $person1, $person2, $person4 ];
    my $array2 = [ $person1, $person3, $person4-&gt;clone(), $person5 ];
    Algorithm::Diff::diff( $array1, $array2, \&amp;Person::hash );

</PRE>


<P>

This would use the 'ssn' field in each Person as a comparison key, and
so would consider <TT>$person4</TT> and <TT>$person4</TT>-&gt;<I>clone()</I> as equal.
<P>

You may also pass additional parameters to the key generation function
if you wish.
