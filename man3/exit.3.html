<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

exit - cause normal process termination
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>void exit(int </B><I>status</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>exit</B>()

function causes normal process termination and the value of <I>status &amp;
0xFF</I> is returned to the parent (see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+wait">wait</A></B>(2)).

<P>

All functions registered with
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+atexit">atexit</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+on_exit">on_exit</A></B>(3)

are called, in the reverse order of their registration.
(It is possible for one of these functions to use
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+atexit">atexit</A></B>(3)

or
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+on_exit">on_exit</A></B>(3)

to register an additional
function to be executed during exit processing;
the new registration is added to the front of the list of functions
that remain to be called.)
If one of these functions does not return
(e.g., it calls
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+_exit">_exit</A></B>(2),

or kills itself with a signal),
then none of the remaining functions is called,
and further exit processing (in particular, flushing of
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+stdio">stdio</A></B>(3)

streams) is abandoned.
If a function has been registered multiple times using
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+atexit">atexit</A></B>(3)

or
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+on_exit">on_exit</A></B>(3),

then it is called as many times as it was registered.
<P>

All open
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+stdio">stdio</A></B>(3)

streams are flushed and closed.
Files created by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+tmpfile">tmpfile</A></B>(3)

are removed.
<P>

The C standard specifies two constants,
<B>EXIT_SUCCESS</B> and <B>EXIT_FAILURE</B>,
that may be passed to
<B>exit</B>()

to indicate successful or unsuccessful
termination, respectively.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The
<B>exit</B>()

function does not return.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ATTRIBUTES</H2>

For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+attributes">attributes</A></B>(7).

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><B>Interface</B></TD><TD><B>Attribute</B></TD><TD><B>Value</B><BR></TD></TR>

<B>exit</B>()

</TD><TD>Thread safety</TD><TD>MT-Unsafe race:exit<BR></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>

The
<B>exit</B>()

function uses a global variable that is not protected,
so it is not thread-safe.

<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C89, C99, SVr4, 4.3BSD.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

The behavior is undefined if one of the functions registered using
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+atexit">atexit</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+on_exit">on_exit</A></B>(3)

calls either
<B>exit</B>()

or
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+longjmp">longjmp</A></B>(3).

Note that a call to
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+execve">execve</A></B>(2)

removes registrations created using
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+atexit">atexit</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+on_exit">on_exit</A></B>(3).

<P>

The use of
<B>EXIT_SUCCESS</B>

and
<B>EXIT_FAILURE</B>

is slightly more portable
(to non-UNIX environments) than the use of 0 and some nonzero value
like 1 or -1.
In particular, VMS uses a different convention.
<P>

BSD has attempted to standardize exit codes
(which some C libraries such as the GNU C library have also adopted);
see the file
<I>&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sysexits.h">sysexits.h</A>&gt;</I>.

<P>

After
<B>exit</B>(),

the exit status must be transmitted to the
parent process.
There are three cases:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">&bull;<DD>
If the parent has set
<B>SA_NOCLDWAIT</B>,

or has set the
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

handler to
<B>SIG_IGN</B>,

the status is discarded and the child dies immediately.
<DT id="2">&bull;<DD>
If the parent was waiting on the child,
it is notified of the exit status and the child dies immediately.
<DT id="3">&bull;<DD>
Otherwise,
the child becomes a &quot;zombie&quot; process:
most of the process resources are recycled,
but a slot containing minimal information about the child process
(termination status, resource usage statistics) is retained in process table.
This allows the parent to subsequently use
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+waitpid">waitpid</A></B>(2)

(or similar) to learn the termination status of the child;
at that point the zombie process slot is released.
</DL>
<P>

If the implementation supports the
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

signal, this signal
is sent to the parent.
If the parent has set
<B>SA_NOCLDWAIT</B>,

it is undefined whether a
<B>SIGCHLD</B>

signal is sent.

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Signals sent to other processes</H3>

If the exiting process is a session leader and its controlling terminal
is the controlling terminal of the session, then each process in
the foreground process group of this controlling terminal
is sent a
<B>SIGHUP</B>

signal, and the terminal is disassociated
from this session, allowing it to be acquired by a new controlling
process.
<P>

If the exit of the process causes a process group to become orphaned,
and if any member of the newly orphaned process group is stopped,
then a
<B>SIGHUP</B>

signal followed by a
<B>SIGCONT</B>

signal will be
sent to each process in this process group.
See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+setpgid">setpgid</A></B>(2)

for an explanation of orphaned process groups.
<P>

Except in the above cases,
where the signalled processes may be children of the terminating process,
termination of a process does
<I>not</I>

in general cause a signal to be sent to children of that process.
However, a process can use the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+prctl">prctl</A></B>(2)

<B>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</B>

operation to arrange that it receives a signal if its parent terminates.
