<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



The
<B>crypt</B>

 
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
<B>crypt_rn</B>

 
and
<B>crypt_ra</B>

functions irreversibly
``hash''

Fa phrase

for storage in the system password database
(<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+shadow">shadow</A>(5)

)

using a cryptographic
``hashing method.''

The result of this operation is called a
``hashed passphrase''

or just a
``hash.''

Hashing methods are described in
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+crypt">crypt</A>(5).


<P>

Fa setting

controls which hashing method to use,
and also supplies various parameters to the chosen method,
most importantly a random
``salt''

which ensures that no two stored hashes are the same,
even if the
Fa phrase

strings are the same.
<P>

The
Fa data

argument to
<B>crypt_r</B>

is a structure of type
Vt struct crypt_data .

It has at least these fields:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
struct crypt_data {
    char output[CRYPT_OUTPUT_SIZE];
    char setting[CRYPT_OUTPUT_SIZE];
    char phrase[CRYPT_MAX_PASSPHRASE_SIZE];
    char initialized;
};
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

Upon a successful return from
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
the hashed passphrase will be stored in
Fa output .

Applications are encouraged, but not required, to use the
Fa phrase

and
Fa setting

fields to store the strings that they will pass as
Fa phrase

and
Fa setting

to
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
This will make it easier to erase all sensitive data
after it is no longer needed.
<P>

The
Fa initialized

field must be set to zero before the first time a
Vt struct crypt_data

object is first used in a call to
Fn crypt_r .

We recommend zeroing the entire object,
not just
Fa initialized

and not just the documented fields,
before the first use.
(Of course, do this before storing anything in
Fa setting

and
Fa phrase . )

<P>

The
Fa data

argument to
<B>crypt_rn</B>

should also point to a
Vt struct crypt_data

object, and
Fa size

should be the size of that object, cast to
Vt int .

When used with
<B>crypt_rn</B>

 
the entire
Fa data

object (except for the
Fa phrase

and
Fa setting

fields) must be zeroed before its first use;
this is not just a recommendation, as it is for
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
Otherwise, the fields of the object have the same uses that they do for
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
<P>

On the first call to
<B>crypt_ra</B>

 
Fa data

should be the address of a
Vt void *

variable set to NULL, and
Fa size

should be the address of an
Vt int

variable set to zero.
<B>crypt_ra</B>

will allocate and initialize a
Vt struct crypt_data

object, using
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+malloc">malloc</A>(3),


and write its address and size into the variables pointed to by
Fa data

and
Fa size .

These can be reused in subsequent calls.
After the application is done hashing passphrases,
it should deallocate the
Vt struct crypt_data

object using
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+free">free</A>(3).


<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<B>crypt</B>

 
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
<B>crypt_rn</B>

 
and
<B>crypt_ra</B>

return a pointer to a string which encodes both the hashed passphrase,
and the settings that were used to encode it.
This string is directly usable as
Fa setting

in other calls to
<B>crypt</B>

 
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
<B>crypt_rn</B>

 
and
<B>crypt_ra</B>

 
and as
Fa prefix

in calls to
<B>crypt_gensalt</B>

 
<B>crypt_gensalt_rn</B>

 
and
<B>crypt_gensalt_ra</B>

 
It will be entirely printable ASCII,
and will not contain whitespace
or the characters
`<B>:</B>

'

 
`<B>;</B>

'

 
`<B>*</B>

'

 
`<B>!</B>

'

 
or
`<B>\</B>

'

 
See
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+crypt">crypt</A>(5)


for more detail on the format of hashed passphrases.
<P>

<B>crypt</B>

places its result in a static storage area,
which will be overwritten by subsequent calls to
<B>crypt</B>

 
It is not safe to call
<B>crypt</B>

from multiple threads simultaneously.
<P>

<B>crypt_r</B>

 
<B>crypt_rn</B>

 
and
<B>crypt_ra</B>

place their result in the
Fa output

field of their
Fa data

argument.
It is safe to call them from multiple threads simultaneously,
as long as a separate
Fa data

object is used for each thread.
<P>

Upon error,
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
<B>crypt_rn</B>

 
and
<B>crypt_ra</B>

write an
<I>invalid</I>

hashed passphrase to the
Fa output

field of their
Fa data

argument, and
<B>crypt</B>

writes an invalid hash to its static storage area.
This string will be shorter than 13 characters,
will begin with a
`<B>*</B>

'

 
and will not compare equal to
Fa setting .

<P>

Upon error,
<B>crypt_rn</B>

and
<B>crypt_ra</B>

return a null pointer.
<B>crypt_r</B>

and
<B>crypt</B>

may also return a null pointer,
or they may return a pointer to the invalid hash,
depending on how libcrypt was configured.
(The option to return the invalid hash is for compatibility
with old applications that assume that
<B>crypt</B>

cannot return a null pointer.
See
Sx PORTABILITY NOTES

below.)
<P>

All four functions set
<I>errno</I>

when they fail.

<DT id="2"><B>Er </B>ERANGE


<DD>

(more than
<B>CRYPT_MAX_PASSPHRASE_SIZE</B>

characters; some hashing methods may have lower limits).
<BR>

<B>crypt_rn</B>

<DT id="4"><B>Er </B>ENOSYS <B>or Er </B>EOPNOTSUPP






<DD>
Hashing passphrases is not supported at all on this installation,
or the hashing method requested by
Fa setting

is not supported.
These error codes are not used by this version of libcrypt,
but may be encountered on other systems.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PORTABILITY NOTES</H2>

<B>crypt</B>

is included in POSIX, but
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
<B>crypt_rn</B>

 
and
<B>crypt_ra</B>

are not part of any standard.
<P>

POSIX does not specify any hashing methods,
and does not require hashed passphrases to be portable between systems.
In practice, hashed passphrases are portable
as long as both systems support the hashing method that was used.
However, the set of supported hashing methods
varies considerably from system to system.
<P>

The behavior of
<B>crypt</B>

on errors isn't well standardized.
Some implementations simply can't fail
(except by crashing the program),
others return a null pointer or a fixed string.
Most implementations don't set
<I>errno</I>

 
but some do.
POSIX specifies returning a null pointer and setting
<I>errno</I>

 
but it defines only one possible error,
Er ENOSYS ,

in the case where
<B>crypt</B>

is not supported at all.
Some older applications are not prepared to handle null pointers
returned by
<B>crypt</B>

 
The behavior described above for this implementation,
setting
<I>errno</I>

and returning an invalid hashed passphrase different from
Fa setting ,

is chosen to make these applications fail closed when an error occurs.
<P>

Due to historical restrictions
on the export of cryptographic software from the USA,
<B>crypt</B>

is an optional POSIX component.
Applications should therefore be prepared for
<B>crypt</B>

not to be available,
or to always fail (setting
<I>errno</I>

to
Er ENOSYS )

at runtime.
<P>

POSIX specifies that
<B>crypt</B>

is declared in
In unistd.h ,

but only if the macro
<B>_XOPEN_CRYPT</B>

is defined and has a value greater than or equal to zero.
Since libcrypt does not provide
In unistd.h ,

it declares
<B>crypt</B>

 
<B>crypt_r</B>

 
<B>crypt_rn</B>

 
and
<B>crypt_ra</B>

in
In crypt.h

instead.
<P>

On a minority of systems (notably recent versions of Solaris),
<B>crypt</B>

uses a thread-specific static storage buffer,
which makes it safe to call from multiple threads simultaneously,
but does not prevent each call within a thread
from overwriting the results of the previous one.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

Some implementations of
<B>crypt</B>

 
upon error,
return an invalid hash that is stored in a read-only location
or only initialized once,
which means that it is only safe to erase the buffer pointed to by the
<B>crypt</B>

return value if an error did not occur.
<P>

Vt struct crypt_data

may be quite large (32kB in this implementation of libcrypt;
over 128kB in some other implementations).
This is large enough that it may be unwise to allocate it on the stack.
<P>

Some recently designed hashing methods need even more scratch memory,
but the
<B>crypt_r</B>

interface makes it impossible to change the size of
Vt struct crypt_data

without breaking binary compatibility.
The
<B>crypt_rn</B>

interface could accommodate larger allocations for specific hashing methods,
but the caller of
<B>crypt_rn</B>

has no way of knowing how much memory to allocate.
<B>crypt_ra</B>

does the allocation itself,
but can only make a single call to
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+malloc">malloc</A>(3).
