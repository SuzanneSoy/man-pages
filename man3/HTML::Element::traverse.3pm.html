HTML::Element::traverse - discussion of HTML::Element's traverse method
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSION</H2>



This document describes version 5.07 of
HTML::Element::traverse, released August 31, 2017
as part of HTML-Tree.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>





<PRE>
  # $element-&gt;traverse is unnecessary and obscure.
  #   Don't use it in new code.

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



<TT>&quot;HTML::Element&quot;</TT> provides a method <TT>&quot;traverse&quot;</TT> that traverses the tree
and calls user-specified callbacks for each node, in pre- or
post-order.  However, use of the method is quite superfluous: if you
want to recursively visit every node in the tree, it's almost always
simpler to write a subroutine does just that, than it is to bundle up
the pre- and/or post-order code in callbacks for the <TT>&quot;traverse&quot;</TT>
method.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>



Suppose you want to traverse at/under a node <TT>$tree</TT> and give elements
an 'id' attribute unless they already have one.
<P>

You can use the <TT>&quot;traverse&quot;</TT> method:
<P>



<PRE>
  {
    my $counter = 'x0000';
    $start_node-&gt;traverse(
      [ # Callbacks;
        # pre-order callback:
        sub {
          my $x = $_[0];
          $x-&gt;attr('id', $counter++) unless defined $x-&gt;attr('id');
          return HTML::Element::OK; # keep traversing
        },
        # post-order callback:
        undef
      ],
      1, # don't call the callbacks for text nodes
    );
  }

</PRE>


<P>

or you can just be simple and clear (and not have to understand the
calling format for <TT>&quot;traverse&quot;</TT>) by writing a sub that traverses the
tree by just calling itself:
<P>



<PRE>
  {
    my $counter = 'x0000';
    sub give_id {
      my $x = $_[0];
      $x-&gt;attr('id', $counter++) unless defined $x-&gt;attr('id');
      foreach my $c ($x-&gt;content_list) {
        give_id($c) if ref $c; # ignore text nodes
      }
    };
    give_id($start_node);
  }

</PRE>


<P>

See, isn't that nice and clear?
<P>

But, if you really need to know:
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE TRAVERSE METHOD</H2>



The <TT>&quot;traverse()&quot;</TT> method is a general object-method for traversing a
tree or subtree and calling user-specified callbacks.  It accepts the
following syntaxes:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">$h-&gt;traverse(\&amp;callback)<DD>





<DT id="2">or $h-&gt;traverse(\&amp;callback, $ignore_text)<DD>




<DT id="3">or $h-&gt;traverse( [\&amp;pre_callback,\&amp;post_callback] , $ignore_text)<DD>





</DL>
<P>

These all mean to traverse the element and all of its children.  That
is, this method starts at node <TT>$h</TT>, ``pre-order visits'' <TT>$h</TT>, traverses its
children, and then will ``post-order visit'' <TT>$h</TT>.  ``Visiting'' means that
the callback routine is called, with these arguments:
<P>



<PRE>
    $_[0] : the node (element or text segment),
    $_[1] : a startflag, and
    $_[2] : the depth

</PRE>


<P>

If the <TT>$ignore_text</TT> parameter is given and true, then the pre-order
call <I>will not</I> be happen for text content.
<P>

The startflag is 1 when we enter a node (i.e., in pre-order calls) and
0 when we leave the node (in post-order calls).
<P>

Note, however, that post-order calls don't happen for nodes that are
text segments or are elements that are prototypically empty (like ``br'',
``hr'', etc.).
<P>

If we visit text nodes (i.e., unless <TT>$ignore_text</TT> is given and true),
then when text nodes are visited, we will also pass two extra
arguments to the callback:
<P>



<PRE>
    $_[3] : the element that's the parent
             of this text node
    $_[4] : the index of this text node
             in its parent's content list

</PRE>


<P>

Note that you can specify that the pre-order routine can
be a different routine from the post-order one:
<P>



<PRE>
    $h-&gt;traverse( [\&amp;pre_callback,\&amp;post_callback], ...);

</PRE>


<P>

You can also specify that no post-order calls are to be made,
by providing a false value as the post-order routine:
<P>



<PRE>
    $h-&gt;traverse([ \&amp;pre_callback,0 ], ...);

</PRE>


<P>

And similarly for suppressing pre-order callbacks:
<P>



<PRE>
    $h-&gt;traverse([ 0,\&amp;post_callback ], ...);

</PRE>


<P>

Note that these two syntaxes specify the same operation:
<P>



<PRE>
    $h-&gt;traverse([\&amp;foo,\&amp;foo], ...);
    $h-&gt;traverse( \&amp;foo       , ...);

</PRE>


<P>

The return values from calls to your pre- or post-order
routines are significant, and are used to control recursion
into the tree.
<P>

These are the values you can return, listed in descending order
of my estimation of their usefulness:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4">HTML::Element::OK, 1, or any other true value<DD>


...to keep on traversing.


<P>


Note that <TT>&quot;HTML::Element::OK&quot;</TT> et
al are constants.  So if you're running under <TT>&quot;use strict&quot;</TT>
(as I hope you are), and you say:
<TT>&quot;return HTML::Element::PRUEN&quot;</TT>
the compiler will flag this as an error (an unallowable
bareword, specifically), whereas if you spell <FONT SIZE="-1">PRUNE</FONT> correctly,
the compiler will not complain.
<DT id="5">undef, 0, '0', '', or HTML::Element::PRUNE<DD>


...to block traversing under the current element's content.
(This is ignored if received from a post-order callback,
since by then the recursion has already happened.)
If this is returned by a pre-order callback, no
post-order callback for the current node will happen.
(Recall that if your callback exits with just <TT>&quot;return;&quot;</TT>,
it is returning undef --- at least in scalar context, and
<TT>&quot;traverse&quot;</TT> always calls your callbacks in scalar context.)
<DT id="6">HTML::Element::ABORT<DD>


...to abort the whole traversal immediately.
This is often useful when you're looking for just the first
node in the tree that meets some criterion of yours.
<DT id="7">HTML::Element::PRUNE_UP<DD>


...to abort continued traversal into this node and its parent
node.  No post-order callback for the current or parent
node will happen.
<DT id="8">HTML::Element::PRUNE_SOFTLY<DD>


Like <FONT SIZE="-1">PRUNE,</FONT> except that the post-order call for the current
node is not blocked.
</DL>
<P>

Almost every task to do with extracting information from a tree can be
expressed in terms of traverse operations (usually in only one pass,
and usually paying attention to only pre-order, or to only
post-order), or operations based on traversing. (In fact, many of the
other methods in this class are basically calls to <B>traverse()</B> with
particular arguments.)
<P>

The source code for HTML::Element and HTML::TreeBuilder contain
several examples of the use of the ``traverse'' method to gather
information about the content of trees and subtrees.
<P>

(Note: you should not change the structure of a tree <I>while</I> you are
traversing it.)
<P>

<H3>Traversing with Recursive Anonymous Routines</H3>



Now, if you've been reading
<I>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</I> too much, maybe
you even want a recursive lambda.  Go ahead:
<P>



<PRE>
  {
    my $counter = 'x0000';
    my $give_id;
    $give_id = sub {
      my $x = $_[0];
      $x-&gt;attr('id', $counter++) unless defined $x-&gt;attr('id');
      foreach my $c ($x-&gt;content_list) {
        $give_id-&gt;($c) if ref $c; # ignore text nodes
      }
    };
    $give_id-&gt;($start_node);
    undef $give_id;
  }

</PRE>


<P>

It's a bit nutty, and it's <I>still</I> more concise than a call to the
<TT>&quot;traverse&quot;</TT> method!
<P>

It is left as an exercise to the reader to figure out how to do the
same thing without using a <TT>$give_id</TT> symbol at all.
<P>

It is also left as an exercise to the reader to figure out why I
undefine <TT>$give_id</TT>, above; and why I could achieved the same effect
with any of:
<P>



<PRE>
    $give_id = 'I like pie!';
   # or...
    $give_id = [];
   # or even;
    $give_id = sub { print &quot;Mmmm pie!\n&quot; };

</PRE>


<P>

But not:
<P>



<PRE>
    $give_id = sub { print &quot;I'm $give_id and I like pie!\n&quot; };
   # nor...
    $give_id = \$give_id;
   # nor...
    $give_id = { 'pie' =&gt; \$give_id, 'mode' =&gt; 'a la' };

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Doing Recursive Things Iteratively</H3>



Note that you may at times see an iterative implementation of
pre-order traversal, like so:
<P>



<PRE>
   {
     my @to_do = ($tree); # start-node
     while(@to_do) {
       my $this = shift @to_do;

       # &quot;Visit&quot; the node:
       $this-&gt;attr('id', $counter++)
        unless defined $this-&gt;attr('id');

       unshift @to_do, grep ref $_, $this-&gt;content_list;
        # Put children on the stack -- they'll be visited next
     }
   }

</PRE>


<P>

This can <I>under certain circumstances</I> be more efficient than just a
normal recursive routine, but at the cost of being rather obscure.  It
gains efficiency by avoiding the overhead of function-calling, but
since there are several method dispatches however you do it (to
<TT>&quot;attr&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;content_list&quot;</TT>), the overhead for a simple function call
is insignificant.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Pruning and Whatnot</H3>



The <TT>&quot;traverse&quot;</TT> method does have the fairly neat features of
the <TT>&quot;ABORT&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;PRUNE_UP&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;PRUNE_SOFTLY&quot;</TT> signals.  None of these
can be implemented <I>totally</I> straightforwardly with recursive
routines, but it is quite possible.  <TT>&quot;ABORT&quot;</TT>-like behavior can be
implemented either with using non-local returning with <TT>&quot;eval&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;die&quot;</TT>:
<P>



<PRE>
  my $died_on; # if you need to know where...
  sub thing {
    ... visits $_[0]...
    ... maybe set $died_on to $_[0] and die &quot;ABORT_TRAV&quot; ...
    ... else call thing($child) for each child...
    ...any post-order visiting $_[0]...
  }
  eval { thing($node) };
  if($@) {
    if($@ =~ m&lt;^ABORT_TRAV&gt;) {
      ...it died (aborted) on $died_on...
    } else {
      die $@; # some REAL error happened
    }
  }

</PRE>


<P>

or you can just do it with flags:
<P>



<PRE>
  my($abort_flag, $died_on);
  sub thing {
    ... visits $_[0]...
    ... maybe set $abort_flag = 1; $died_on = $_[0]; return;
    foreach my $c ($_[0]-&gt;content_list) {
      thing($c);
      return if $abort_flag;
    }
    ...any post-order visiting $_[0]...
    return;
  }

  $abort_flag = $died_on = undef;
  thing($node);
  ...if defined $abort_flag, it died on $died_on
