<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

Algorithm::DiffOld - Compute `intelligent' differences between two files / lists
but use the old (&lt;=0.59) interface.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTE</H2>



This has been provided as part of the Algorithm::Diff package by Ned Konz.
This particular module is <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>ONLY</B></FONT><B></B> for people who <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>HAVE</B></FONT><B></B> to have the old
interface, which uses a comparison function rather than a key generating
function.
<P>

Because each of the lines in one array have to be compared with each 
of the lines in the other array, this does M*N comparisons. This can
be very slow. I clocked it at taking 18 times as long as the stock
version of Algorithm::Diff for a 4000-line file. It will get worse
quadratically as array sizes increase.

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>





<PRE>
  use Algorithm::DiffOld qw(diff LCS traverse_sequences);

  @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function );

  $lcsref = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function );

  @diffs = diff( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function );
  
  traverse_sequences( \@seq1, \@seq2,
                     { MATCH =&gt; $callback,
                       DISCARD_A =&gt; $callback,
                       DISCARD_B =&gt; $callback,
                     },
                     $comparison_function );

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMPARISON FUNCTIONS</H2>



Each of the main routines should be passed a comparison function. If you
aren't passing one in, <B>use Algorithm::Diff instead</B>.
<P>

These functions should return a true value when two items should compare
as equal.
<P>

For instance,
<P>



<PRE>
  @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, sub { my ($a, $b) = @_; $a eq $b } );

</PRE>


<P>

but if that is all you're doing with your comparison function, just use
Algorithm::Diff and let it do this (this is its default).
<P>

Or:
<P>



<PRE>
  sub someFunkyComparisonFunction
  {
        my ($a, $b) = @_;
        $a =~ m{$b};
  }

  @diffs = diff( \@lines, \@patterns, \&amp;someFunkyComparisonFunction );

</PRE>


<P>

which would allow you to diff an array <TT>@lines</TT> which consists of text
lines with an array <TT>@patterns</TT> which consists of regular expressions.
<P>

This is actually the reason I wrote this version --- there is no way
to do this with a key generation function as in the stock Algorithm::Diff.
<P>
