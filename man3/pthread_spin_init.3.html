<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>General note</I>:

Most programs should use mutexes
instead of spin locks.
Spin locks are primarily useful in conjunction with real-time
scheduling policies.
See NOTES.
<P>

The
<B>pthread_spin_init</B>()

function allocates any resources required for the use of
the spin lock referred to by
<I>lock</I>

and initializes the lock to be in the unlocked state.
The
<I>pshared</I>

argument must have one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2"><B>PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE</B>

<DD>
The spin lock is to be operated on only by threads in the same process
as the thread that calls
<B>pthread_spin_init</B>().

(Attempting to share the spin lock between processes
results in undefined behavior.)
<DT id="3"><B>PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED</B>

<DD>
The spin lock may be operated on by any thread in any process that
has access to the memory containing the lock
(i.e., the lock may be in a shared memory object that is
shared among multiple processes).
</DL>
<P>

Calling
<B>pthread_spin_init</B>()

on a spin lock that has already been initialized results
in undefined behavior.
<P>

The
<B>pthread_spin_destroy</B>()

function destroys a previously initialized spin lock,
freeing any resources that were allocated for that lock.
Destroying a spin lock that has not been previously been initialized
or destroying a spin lock while another thread holds the lock
results in undefined behavior.
<P>

Once a spin lock has been destroyed,
performing any operation on the lock other than
once more initializing it with
<B>pthread_spin_init</B>()

results in undefined behavior.
<P>

The result of performing operations such as
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+pthread_spin_lock">pthread_spin_lock</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+pthread_spin_unlock">pthread_spin_unlock</A></B>(3),

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+pthread_spin_destroy">pthread_spin_destroy</A></B>(3)

on
<I>copies</I>

of the object referred to by
<I>lock</I>

is undefined.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, there functions return zero.
On failure, they return an error number.
In the event that
<B>pthread_spin_init</B>()

fails, the lock is not initialized.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<B>pthread_spin_init</B>()

may fail with the following errors:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4"><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
The system has insufficient resources to initialize
a new spin lock.
<DT id="5"><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Insufficient memory to initialize the spin lock.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.2.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001.
<P>

Support for process-shared spin locks is a POSIX option.
The option is supported in the glibc implementation.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Spin locks should be employed in conjunction with
real-time scheduling policies
(<B>SCHED_FIFO</B>,

or possibly
<B>SCHED_RR</B>).

Use of spin locks with nondeterministic scheduling policies such as
<B>SCHED_OTHER</B>

probably indicates a design mistake.
The problem is that if a thread operating under such a policy
is scheduled off the CPU while it holds a spin lock,
then other threads will waste time spinning on the lock
until the lock holder is once more rescheduled and releases the lock.
<P>

If threads create a deadlock situation while employing spin locks,
those threads will spin forever consuming CPU time.
<P>

User-space spin locks are
<I>not</I>

applicable as a general locking solution.
They are, by definition,
prone to priority inversion and unbounded spin times.
A programmer using spin locks must be exceptionally careful not
only in the code, but also in terms of system configuration,
thread placement, and priority assignment.
