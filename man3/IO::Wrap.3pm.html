IO::Wrap - wrap raw filehandles in IO::Handle interface
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>





<PRE>
   use IO::Wrap;
       
   ### Do stuff with any kind of filehandle (including a bare globref), or 
   ### any kind of blessed object that responds to a print() message.
   ###
   sub do_stuff {
       my $fh = shift;         
       
       ### At this point, we have no idea what the user gave us... 
       ### a globref? a FileHandle? a scalar filehandle name?
       
       $fh = wraphandle($fh);  
        
       ### At this point, we know we have an IO::Handle-like object!
       
       $fh-&gt;print(&quot;Hey there!&quot;);
       ...
   }

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



Let's say you want to write some code which does I/O, but you don't 
want to force the caller to provide you with a FileHandle or IO::Handle
object.  You want them to be able to say:
<P>



<PRE>
    do_stuff(\*STDOUT);
    do_stuff('STDERR');
    do_stuff($some_FileHandle_object);
    do_stuff($some_IO_Handle_object);

</PRE>


<P>

And even:
<P>



<PRE>
    do_stuff($any_object_with_a_print_method);

</PRE>


<P>

Sure, one way to do it is to force the caller to use <B>tiehandle()</B>.  
But that puts the burden on them.  Another way to do it is to 
use <B>IO::Wrap</B>, which provides you with the following functions:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">wraphandle <FONT SIZE="-1">SCALAR</FONT><DD>


This function will take a single argument, and ``wrap'' it based on
what it seems to be...
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3">&bull;<DD>
<B>A raw scalar filehandle name,</B> like <TT>&quot;STDOUT&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;Class::HANDLE&quot;</TT>.
In this case, the filehandle name is wrapped in an IO::Wrap object, 
which is returned.
<DT id="4">&bull;<DD>
<B>A raw filehandle glob,</B> like <TT>&quot;\*STDOUT&quot;</TT>.
In this case, the filehandle glob is wrapped in an IO::Wrap object, 
which is returned.
<DT id="5">&bull;<DD>
<B>A blessed FileHandle object.</B>
In this case, the FileHandle is wrapped in an IO::Wrap object if and only
if your FileHandle class does not support the <TT>&quot;read()&quot;</TT> method.
<DT id="6">&bull;<DD>
<B>Any other kind of blessed object,</B> which is assumed to be already
conformant to the IO::Handle interface.
In this case, you just get back that object.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="7"><DD>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

If you get back an IO::Wrap object, it will obey a basic subset of
the <FONT SIZE="-1">IO::</FONT> interface.  That is, the following methods (note: I said
<I>methods</I>, not named operators) should work on the thing you get back:
<P>



<PRE>
    close 
    getline 
    getlines 
    print ARGS...
    read BUFFER,NBYTES
    seek POS,WHENCE
    tell

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>



Clearly, when wrapping a raw external filehandle (like \*STDOUT), 
I didn't want to close the file descriptor when the ``wrapper'' object is
destroyed... since the user might not appreciate that!  Hence,
there's no <FONT SIZE="-1">DESTROY</FONT> method in this class.
<P>

When wrapping a FileHandle object, however, I believe that Perl will 
invoke the FileHandle::DESTROY when the last reference goes away,
so in that case, the filehandle is closed if the wrapped FileHandle
really was the last reference to it.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WARNINGS</H2>



This module does not allow you to wrap filehandle names which are given
as strings that lack the package they were opened in. That is, if a user 
opens <FONT SIZE="-1">FOO</FONT> in package Foo, they must pass it to you either as <TT>&quot;\*FOO&quot;</TT> 
or as <TT>&quot;Foo::FOO&quot;</TT>.  However, <TT>&quot;STDIN&quot;</TT> and friends will work just fine.
