<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USAGE</H2>



This module complements Algorithm::Diff by 
providing three-way merge and diff functions.
<P>

In this documentation, the first list to <TT>&quot;diff3&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;merge&quot;</TT>, and 
<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences3&quot;</TT> is 
called the `original' list.  The second list is the `left' list.  The 
third list is the `right' list.
<P>

The optional key generation arguments are the same as in 
Algorithm::Diff.  See Algorithm::Diff for more 
information.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>diff3</H3>



Given references to three lists of items, <TT>&quot;diff3&quot;</TT> performs a 
three-way difference.
<P>

This function returns an array of operations describing how the 
left and right lists differ from the original list.  In scalar 
context, this function returns a reference to such an array.
<P>

Perhaps an example would be useful.
<P>

Given the following three lists,
<P>



<PRE>
  original: a b c   e f   h i   k
      left: a b   d e f g   i j k
     right: a b c d e     h i j k

     merge: a b   d e   g   i j k

</PRE>


<P>

we have the following result from diff3:
<P>



<PRE>
 [ 'u', 'a',   'a',   'a' ],
 [ 'u', 'b',   'b',   'b' ],
 [ 'l', 'c',   undef, 'c' ],
 [ 'o', undef, 'd',   'd' ],
 [ 'u', 'e',   'e',   'e' ],
 [ 'r', 'f',   'f',   undef ], 
 [ 'o', 'h',   'g',   'h' ],
 [ 'u', 'i',   'i',   'i' ],
 [ 'o', undef, 'j',   'j' ],
 [ 'u', 'k',   'k',   'k' ]

</PRE>


<P>

The first element in each row is the array with the difference:
<P>



<PRE>
 c - conflict (no two are the same)
 l - left is different 
 o - original is different
 r - right is different
 u - unchanged

</PRE>


<P>

The next three elements are the lists from the original, left, 
and right arrays respectively that the row refers to (in the synopsis,
these are <TT>@ancestor</TT>, <TT>@a</TT>, and <TT>@b</TT>, respectively).
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>merge</H3>



Given references to three lists of items, <TT>&quot;merge&quot;</TT> performs a three-way 
merge.  The <TT>&quot;merge&quot;</TT> function uses the <TT>&quot;diff3&quot;</TT> function to do most of 
the work.
<P>

The only callback currently used is <TT>&quot;CONFLICT&quot;</TT> which should be a 
reference to a subroutine that accepts two array references.  The 
first array reference is to a list of elements from the left list.  
The second array reference is to a list of elements from the right list.
This callback should return a list of elements to place in the merged 
list in place of the conflict.
<P>

The default <TT>&quot;CONFLICT&quot;</TT> callback returns the following:
<P>



<PRE>
 q{&lt;!-- ------ START CONFLICT ------ --&gt;},
 (@left),
 q{&lt;!-- ---------------------------- --&gt;},
 (@right),
 q{&lt;!-- ------  END  CONFLICT ------ --&gt;},

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>traverse_sequences3</H3>



This is the workhorse function that goes through the three sequences 
and calls the callback functions.
<P>

The following callbacks are supported.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><FONT SIZE="-1">NO_CHANGE</FONT><DD>


This is called if all three sequences have the same element at the 
current position.  The arguments are the current positions within each 
sequence, the first argument being the current position within the 
first sequence.
<DT id="2">A_DIFF<DD>


This is called if the first sequence is different than the other two 
sequences at the current position.
This callback will be called with one, two, or three arguments.


<P>


If one argument, then only the element at the given position from the 
first sequence is not in either of the other two sequences.


<P>


If two arguments, then there is no element in the first sequence that 
corresponds to the elements at the given positions in the second and 
third sequences.


<P>


If three arguments, then the element at the given position in the first 
sequence is different than the corresponding element in the other two 
sequences, but the other two sequences have corresponding elements.
<DT id="3">B_DIFF<DD>


This is called if the second sequence is different than the other two 
sequences at the current position.
This callback will be called with one, two, or three arguments.


<P>


If one argument, then only the element at the given position from the 
second sequence is not in either of the other two sequences.


<P>


If two arguments, then there is no element in the second sequence that 
corresponds to the elements at the given positions in the first and 
third sequences.


<P>


If three arguments, then the element at the given position in the second 
sequence is different than the corresponding element in the other two 
sequences, but the other two sequences have corresponding elements.
<DT id="4">C_DIFF<DD>


This is called if the third sequence is different than the other two 
sequences at the current position.
This callback will be called with one, two, or three arguments.


<P>


If one argument, then only the element at the given position from the 
third sequence is not in either of the other two sequences.


<P>


If two arguments, then there is no element in the third sequence that 
corresponds to the elements at the given positions in the first and 
second sequences.


<P>


If three arguments, then the element at the given position in the third 
sequence is different than the corresponding element in the other two 
sequences, but the other two sequences have corresponding elements.
<DT id="5"><FONT SIZE="-1">CONFLICT</FONT><DD>


This is called if all three sequences have different elements at the 
current position.  The three arguments are the current positions within 
each sequence.

<H2>BUGS</H2>



Most assuredly there are bugs.  If a pattern similar to the above 
example does not work, send it to &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jsmith@cpan.org">jsmith@cpan.org</A>&gt; or report it on 
&lt;<A HREF="http://rt.cpan.org/">http://rt.cpan.org/</A>&gt;, the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> bug tracker.
<P>

Algorithm::Diff's implementation of 
<TT>&quot;traverse_sequences&quot;</TT> may not be symmetric with respect to the input 
sequences if the second and third sequence are of different lengths.  
Because of this, <TT>&quot;traverse_sequences3&quot;</TT> will calculate the diffs of 
the second and third sequences as passed and swapped.  If the differences 
are not the same, it will issue an `Algorithm::Diff::diff is not symmetric 
for second and third sequences...' warning.  It will try to handle 
this, but there may be some cases where it can't.
