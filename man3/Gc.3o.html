Do a minor collection and a slice of major collection.

<P>
<P>
<B>finalise f v</B>

registers 
<B>f</B>

as a finalisation function for 
<B>v</B>

.
<B>v</B>

must be heap-allocated.  
<B>f</B>

will be called with 
<B>v</B>

as
argument at some point between the first time 
<B>v</B>

becomes unreachable
(including through weak pointers) and the time 
<B>v</B>

is collected by
the GC. Several functions can
be registered for the same value, or even several instances of the
same function.  Each instance will be called once (or never,
if the program terminates before 
<B>v</B>

becomes unreachable).
<P>
The GC will call the finalisation functions in the order of
deallocation.  When several values become unreachable at the
same time (i.e. during the same GC cycle), the finalisation
functions will be called in the reverse order of the corresponding
calls to 
<B>finalise</B>

.  If 
<B>finalise</B>

is called in the same order
as the values are allocated, that means each value is finalised
before the values it depends upon.  Of course, this becomes
false if additional dependencies are introduced by assignments.
<P>
In the presence of multiple OCaml threads it should be assumed that
any particular finaliser may be executed in any of the threads.
<P>
Anything reachable from the closure of finalisation functions
is considered reachable, so the following code will not work
as expected:
<P>
-
<B>let v = ... in Gc.finalise (fun _ -&gt; ...v...) v </B>

<P>
Instead you should make sure that 
<B>v</B>

is not in the closure of
the finalisation function by writing:
<P>
-
<B>let f = fun x -&gt; ...  let v = ... in Gc.finalise f v </B>

<P>
The 
<B>f</B>

function can use all features of OCaml, including
assignments that make the value reachable again.  It can also
loop forever (in this case, the other
finalisation functions will not be called during the execution of f,
unless it calls 
<B>finalise_release</B>

).
It can call 
<B>finalise</B>

on 
<B>v</B>

or other values to register other
functions or even itself.  It can raise an exception; in this case
the exception will interrupt whatever the program was doing when
the function was called.
<P>
<P>
<B>finalise</B>

will raise 
<B>Invalid_argument</B>

if 
<B>v</B>

is not
guaranteed to be heap-allocated.  Some examples of values that are not
heap-allocated are integers, constant constructors, booleans,
the empty array, the empty list, the unit value.  The exact list
of what is heap-allocated or not is implementation-dependent.
Some constant values can be heap-allocated but never deallocated
during the lifetime of the program, for example a list of integer
constants; this is also implementation-dependent.
Note that values of types 
<B>float</B>

are sometimes allocated and
sometimes not, so finalising them is unsafe, and 
<B>finalise</B>

will
also raise 
<B>Invalid_argument</B>

for them. Values of type 
<B>'a Lazy.t</B>

(for any 
<B>'a</B>

) are like 
<B>float</B>

in this respect, except that the
compiler sometimes optimizes them in a way that prevents 
<B>finalise</B>

from detecting them. In this case, it will not raise
<B>Invalid_argument</B>

, but you should still avoid calling 
<B>finalise</B>

on lazy values.
<P>
The results of calling 
<B>String.make</B>

, 
<B>Bytes.make</B>

, 
<B>Bytes.create</B>

<B>Array.make</B>

<P>
same as 
<B>Gc.finalise</B>

except the value is not given as argument. So
you can't use the given value for the computation of the
finalisation function. The benefit is that the function is called
after the value is unreachable for the last time instead of the
first time. So contrary to 
<B>Gc.finalise</B>

the value will never be
reachable again or used again. In particular every weak pointer
and ephemeron that contained this value as key or data is unset
before running the finalisation function. Moreover the finalisation
functions attached with 
<B>Gc.finalise</B>

are always called before the
finalisation functions attached with
