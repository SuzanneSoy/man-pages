<H2>NAME</H2>

URI::file - URI that maps to local file names
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>





<PRE>
 use URI::file;
 
 $u1 = URI-&gt;new(&quot;file:/foo/bar&quot;);
 $u2 = URI-&gt;new(&quot;foo/bar&quot;, &quot;file&quot;);
 
 $u3 = URI::file-&gt;new($path);
 $u4 = URI::file-&gt;new(&quot;c:\\windows\\&quot;, &quot;win32&quot;);
 
 $u1-&gt;file;
 $u1-&gt;file(&quot;mac&quot;);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



The <TT>&quot;URI::file&quot;</TT> class supports <TT>&quot;URI&quot;</TT> objects belonging to the <I>file</I>
<FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> scheme.  This scheme allows us to map the conventional file names
found on various computer systems to the <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> name space.  An old
specification of the <I>file</I> <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> scheme is found in <FONT SIZE="-1">RFC 1738.</FONT>  Some
older background information is also in <FONT SIZE="-1">RFC 1630.</FONT> There are no newer
specifications as far as I know.
<P>

If you simply want to construct <I>file</I> <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> objects from <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> strings,
use the normal <TT>&quot;URI&quot;</TT> constructor.  If you want to construct <I>file</I>
<FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> objects from the actual file names used by various systems, then
use one of the following <TT>&quot;URI::file&quot;</TT> constructors:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">$u = URI::file-&gt;new( $filename, [$os] )<DD>




Maps a file name to the <I>file:</I> <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> name space, creates a <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> object
and returns it.  The <TT>$filename</TT> is interpreted as belonging to the
indicated operating system ($os), which defaults to the value of the
$^O variable.  The <TT>$filename</TT> can be either absolute or relative, and
the corresponding type of <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> object for <TT>$os</TT> is returned.
<DT id="2">$u = URI::file-&gt;new_abs( $filename, [$os] )<DD>




Same as URI::file-&gt;new, but makes sure that the <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> returned
represents an absolute file name.  If the <TT>$filename</TT> argument is
relative, then the name is resolved relative to the current directory,
i.e. this constructor is really the same as:


<P>




<PRE>
  URI::file-&gt;new($filename)-&gt;abs(URI::file-&gt;cwd);

</PRE>


<DT id="3">$u = URI::file-&gt;cwd<DD>




Returns a <I>file</I> <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> that represents the current working directory.
See Cwd.
</DL>
<P>

The following methods are supported for <I>file</I> <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> (in addition to
the common and generic methods described in <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT>):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4">$u-&gt;file( [$os] )<DD>




Returns a file name.  It maps from the <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> name space
to the file name space of the indicated operating system.


<P>


It might return <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> if the name can not be represented in the
indicated file system.
<DT id="5">$u-&gt;dir( [$os] )<DD>




Some systems use a different form for names of directories than for plain
files.  Use this method if you know you want to use the name for
a directory.
</DL>
<P>

The <TT>&quot;URI::file&quot;</TT> module can be used to map generic file names to names
suitable for the current system.  As such, it can work as a nice
replacement for the <TT>&quot;File::Spec&quot;</TT> module.  For instance, the following
code translates the UNIX-style file name <I>Foo/Bar.pm</I> to a name
suitable for the local system:
<P>



<PRE>
  $file = URI::file-&gt;new(&quot;Foo/Bar.pm&quot;, &quot;unix&quot;)-&gt;file;
  die &quot;Can't map filename Foo/Bar.pm for $^O&quot; unless defined $file;
  open(FILE, $file) || die &quot;Can't open '$file': $!&quot;;
  # do something with FILE

</PRE>

<H2>MAPPING NOTES</H2>



Most computer systems today have hierarchically organized file systems.
Mapping the names used in these systems to the generic <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> syntax
allows us to work with relative file URIs that behave as they should
when resolved using the generic algorithm for URIs (specified in <FONT SIZE="-1">RFC
2396</FONT>).  Mapping a file name to the generic <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> syntax involves mapping
the path separator character to ``/'' and encoding any reserved
characters that appear in the path segments of the file name.  If
path segments consisting of the strings ``.'' or ``..'' have a
different meaning than what is specified for generic URIs, then these
must be encoded as well.
<P>

If the file system has device, volume or drive specifications as
the root of the name space, then it makes sense to map them to the
authority field of the generic <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> syntax.  This makes sure that
relative URIs can not be resolved ``above'' them, i.e. generally how
relative file names work in those systems.
<P>

Another common use of the authority field is to encode the host on which
this file name is valid.  The host name ``localhost'' is special and
generally has the same meaning as a missing or empty authority
field.  This use is in conflict with using it as a device
specification, but can often be resolved for device specifications
having characters not legal in plain host names.
<P>

File name to <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> mapping in normally not one-to-one.  There are
usually many URIs that map to any given file name.  For instance, an
authority of ``localhost'' maps the same as a <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> with a missing or empty
authority.
<P>

Example 1: The Mac classic (Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS 9</FONT> and earlier) used ``:'' as path separator,
but not in the same way as a generic <FONT SIZE="-1">URI.</FONT> ``:foo'' was a relative name.  ``foo:bar''
was an absolute name.  Also, path segments could contain the ``/'' character as well
as the literal ``.'' or ``..''.  So the mapping looks like this:
<P>



<PRE>
  Mac classic           URI
  ----------            -------------------
  :foo:bar     &lt;==&gt;     foo/bar
  :            &lt;==&gt;     ./
  ::foo:bar    &lt;==&gt;     ../foo/bar
  :::          &lt;==&gt;     ../../
  foo:bar      &lt;==&gt;     file:/foo/bar
  foo:bar:     &lt;==&gt;     file:/foo/bar/
  ..           &lt;==&gt;     %2E%2E
  &lt;undef&gt;      &lt;==      /
  foo/         &lt;==      file:/foo%2F
  ./foo.txt    &lt;==      file:/.%2Ffoo.txt

</PRE>


<P>

Note that if you want a relative <FONT SIZE="-1">URL,</FONT> you *must* begin the path with a :.  Any
path that begins with [^:] is treated as absolute.
<P>

Example 2: The <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> file system is easy to map, as it uses the same path
separator as URIs, has a single root, and segments of ``.'' and ``..''
have the same meaning.  URIs that have the character ``\0'' or ``/'' as
part of any path segment can not be turned into valid <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> file names.
<P>



<PRE>
  UNIX                  URI
  ----------            ------------------

  /foo/bar     &lt;==&gt;     file:/foo/bar
  /foo/bar     &lt;==      <A HREF="file://localhost/foo/bar">file://localhost/foo/bar</A>
  file:         ==&gt;     ./file:
  &lt;undef&gt;      &lt;==      file:/fo%00/bar
  /            &lt;==&gt;     file:/

<H2>CONFIGURATION VARIABLES</H2>



The following configuration variables influence how the class and its
methods behave:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="6">%URI::file::OS_CLASS<DD>




This hash maps <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> identifiers to implementation classes.  You might
want to add or modify this if you want to plug in your own file
handler class.  Normally the keys should match the $^O values in use.


<P>


If there is no mapping then the ``Unix'' implementation is used.
<DT id="7">$URI::file::DEFAULT_AUTHORITY<DD>




This determine what ``authority'' string to include in absolute file
URIs.  It defaults to &quot;``.  If you prefer verbose URIs you might set it
to be ''localhost&quot;.


<P>


Setting this value to <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> force behaviour compatible to <FONT SIZE="-1">URI</FONT> v1.31
and earlier.  In this mode host names in <FONT SIZE="-1">UNC</FONT> paths and drive letters
are mapped to the authority component on Windows, while we produce
authority-less URIs on Unix.
