systemd.network - Network configuration
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<I>network</I>.network
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

A plain ini-style text file that encodes network configuration for matching network interfaces, used by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-networkd">systemd-networkd</A></B>(8). See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+systemd.syntax">systemd.syntax</A></B>(7)
for a general description of the syntax.
<P>

The main network file must have the extension
.network; other extensions are ignored. Networks are applied to links whenever the links appear.
<P>

The
.network
files are read from the files located in the system network directories
/lib/systemd/network
and
/usr/local/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live. However, files with identical filenames replace each other. Files in
/etc
have the highest priority, files in
/run
take precedence over files with the same name under
/usr. This can be used to override a system-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is &quot;masked&quot;).
<P>

Along with the network file
foo.network, a &quot;drop-in&quot; directory
foo.network.d/
may exist. All files with the suffix
&quot;.conf&quot;
from this directory will be parsed after the file itself is parsed. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file. Each drop-in file must have appropriate section headers.
<P>

In addition to
/etc/systemd/network, drop-in
&quot;.d&quot;
directories can be placed in
/lib/systemd/network
or
/run/systemd/network
directories. Drop-in files in
/etc
take precedence over those in
/run
which in turn take precedence over those in
/lib. Drop-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main network file wherever located.
<P>

Note that an interface without any static IPv6 addresses configured, and neither DHCPv6 nor IPv6LL enabled, shall be considered to have no IPv6 support. IPv6 will be automatically disabled for that interface by writing &quot;1&quot; to
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<I>ifname</I>/disable_ipv6.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The network file contains a
&quot;[Match]&quot;
section, which determines if a given network file may be applied to a given device; and a
&quot;[Network]&quot;
section specifying how the device should be configured. The first (in lexical order) of the network files that matches a given device is applied, all later files are ignored, even if they match as well.
<P>

A network file is said to match a network interface if all matches specified by the
&quot;[Match]&quot;
section are satisfied. When a network file does not contain valid settings in
&quot;[Match]&quot;
section, then the file will match all interfaces and
<B>systemd-networkd</B>
warns about that. Hint: to avoid the warning and to make it clear that all interfaces shall be matched, add the following:
<P>

</DL>

<P>

<I>Host=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="14"><DD>
Matches against the hostname or machine ID of the host. See
<I>ConditionHost=</I>
in

</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>[LINK] SECTION OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The
&quot;[Link]&quot;
section accepts the following keys:
<P>

<I>MACAddress=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="19"><DD>
The hardware address to set for the device.
</DL>

<P>

<I>MTUBytes=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="20"><DD>
The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device. The usual suffixes K, M, G, are supported and are understood to the base of 1024.
<P>
Note that if IPv6 is enabled on the interface, and the MTU is chosen below 1280 (the minimum MTU for IPv6) it will automatically be increased to this value.
</DL>

<P>

<I>ARP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="21"><DD>
Takes a boolean. If set to true, the ARP (low-level Address Resolution Protocol) for this interface is enabled. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
<P>
For example, disabling ARP is useful when creating multiple MACVLAN or VLAN virtual interfaces atop a single lower-level physical interface, which will then only serve as a link/&quot;bridge&quot; device aggregating traffic to the same physical link and not participate in the network otherwise.
</DL>

<P>

<I>Multicast=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="22"><DD>
Takes a boolean. If set to true, the multicast flag on the device is enabled.
</DL>

<P>

<I>AllMulticast=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="23"><DD>
Takes a boolean. If set to true, the driver retrieves all multicast packets from the network. This happens when multicast routing is enabled.
</DL>

<P>

<I>Unmanaged=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="24"><DD>
Takes a boolean. When
&quot;yes&quot;, no attempts are made to bring up or configure matching links, equivalent to when there are no matching network files. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.
<P>
This is useful for preventing later matching network files from interfering with certain interfaces that are fully controlled by other applications.
</DL>

<P>

<I>RequiredForOnline=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="25"><DD>
Takes a boolean or a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational state. Please see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+networkctl">networkctl</A></B>(1)
for possible operational states. When
&quot;yes&quot;, the network is deemed required when determining whether the system is online when running
<B>systemd-networkd-wait-online</B>. When
&quot;no&quot;, the network is ignored when checking for online state. When a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational state are set,
&quot;yes&quot;
is implied, and this controls the minimum and maximum operational state required for the network interface to be considered online. Defaults to
&quot;yes&quot;.
<P>
The network will be brought up normally in all cases, but in the event that there is no address being assigned by DHCP or the cable is not plugged in, the link will simply remain offline and be skipped automatically by
<B>systemd-networkd-wait-online</B>
if
&quot;RequiredForOnline=no&quot;.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>[NETWORK] SECTION OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The
&quot;[Network]&quot;
section accepts the following keys:
<P>

<I>Description=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="26"><DD>
A description of the device. This is only used for presentation purposes.
</DL>

<P>

<I>DHCP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="27"><DD>
Enables DHCPv4 and/or DHCPv6 client support. Accepts
&quot;yes&quot;,
&quot;no&quot;,
&quot;ipv4&quot;, or
&quot;ipv6&quot;. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.
<P>
Note that DHCPv6 will by default be triggered by Router Advertisement, if that is enabled, regardless of this parameter. By enabling DHCPv6 support explicitly, the DHCPv6 client will be started regardless of the presence of routers on the link, or what flags the routers pass. See
&quot;IPv6AcceptRA=&quot;.
<P>
Furthermore, note that by default the domain name specified through DHCP, on Ubuntu, are used for name resolution. See option
<B>UseDomains=</B>
below.
<P>
See the
&quot;[DHCPv4]&quot;
or
&quot;[DHCPv6]&quot;
section below for further configuration options for the DHCP client support.
</DL>

<P>

<I>DHCPServer=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="28"><DD>
Takes a boolean. If set to
&quot;yes&quot;, DHCPv4 server will be started. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;. Further settings for the DHCP server may be set in the
&quot;[DHCPServer]&quot;
section described below.
</DL>

<P>

<I>LinkLocalAddressing=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="29"><DD>
Enables link-local address autoconfiguration. Accepts
&quot;yes&quot;,
&quot;no&quot;,
&quot;ipv4&quot;,
&quot;ipv6&quot;,
&quot;fallback&quot;, or
&quot;ipv4-fallback&quot;. If
&quot;fallback&quot;
or
&quot;ipv4-fallback&quot;
is specified, then an IPv4 link-local address is configured only when DHCPv4 fails. If
&quot;fallback&quot;, an IPv6 link-local address is always configured, and if
&quot;ipv4-fallback&quot;, the address is not configured. Note that, the fallback mechanism works only when DHCPv4 client is enabled, that is, it requires
&quot;DHCP=yes&quot;
or
&quot;DHCP=ipv4&quot;. If
<I>Bridge=</I>
is set, defaults to
&quot;no&quot;, and if not, defaults to
&quot;ipv6&quot;.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv4LLRoute=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="30"><DD>
Takes a boolean. If set to true, sets up the route needed for non-IPv4LL hosts to communicate with IPv4LL-only hosts. Defaults to false.
</DL>

<P>

<I>DefaultRouteOnDevice=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="31"><DD>
Takes a boolean. If set to true, sets up the default route bound to the interface. Defaults to false. This is useful when creating routes on point-to-point interfaces. This is equivalent to e.g. the following.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="32"><DD>



<PRE>
ip route add default dev veth99
</PRE>

</DL>




</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6Token=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="33"><DD>
Specifies an optional address generation mode and a required IPv6 address. If the mode is present, the two parts must be separated with a colon
&quot;<I>mode</I>:<I>address</I>&quot;. The address generation mode may be either
<B>prefixstable</B>
or
<B>static</B>. If not specified,
<B>static</B>
is assumed.
<P>
When the mode is set to
<B>static</B>, or unspecified, the lower bits of the supplied address are combined with the upper bits of a prefix received in a Router Advertisement message to form a complete address. Note that if multiple prefixes are received in an RA message, or in multiple RA messages, addresses will be formed from each of them using the supplied address. This mode implements SLAAC but uses a static interface identifier instead of an identifier generated using the EUI-64 algorithm. Because the interface identifier is static, if Duplicate Address Detection detects that the computed address is a duplicate (in use by another node on the link), then this mode will fail to provide an address for that prefix.
<P>
When the mode is set to
&quot;prefixstable&quot;
the RFC 7217 algorithm for generating interface identifiers will be used, but only when a prefix received in an RA message matches the supplied address. See
m[blue]<B>RFC 7217</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>. Prefix matching will be attempted against each
<B>prefixstable</B>
IPv6Token variable provided in the configuration; if a received prefix does not match any of the provided addresses, then the EUI-64 algorithm will be used to form an interface identifier for that prefix. This mode is also SLAAC, but with a potentially stable interface identifier which does not directly map to the interface's hardware address. Note that the
<B>prefixstable</B>
algorithm includes both the interface's name and MAC address in the hash used to compute the interface identifier, so if either of those are changed the resulting interface identifier (and address) will change, even if the prefix received in the RA message has not changed. Note that if multiple
<B>prefixstable</B>
IPv6Token variables are supplied with addresses that match a prefix received in an RA message, only the first one will be used to generate addresses.
</DL>

<P>

<I>LLMNR=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="34"><DD>
Takes a boolean or
&quot;resolve&quot;. When true, enables
m[blue]<B>Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>
on the link. When set to
&quot;resolve&quot;, only resolution is enabled, but not host registration and announcement. Defaults to true. This setting is read by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-resolved.service">systemd-resolved.service</A></B>(8).
</DL>

<P>

<I>MulticastDNS=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="35"><DD>
Takes a boolean or
&quot;resolve&quot;. When true, enables
m[blue]<B>Multicast DNS</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>
support on the link. When set to
&quot;resolve&quot;, only resolution is enabled, but not host or service registration and announcement. Defaults to false. This setting is read by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-resolved.service">systemd-resolved.service</A></B>(8).
</DL>

<P>

<I>DNSOverTLS=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="36"><DD>
Takes a boolean or
&quot;opportunistic&quot;. When true, enables
m[blue]<B>DNS-over-TLS</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[4]</FONT>
support on the link. When set to
&quot;opportunistic&quot;, compatibility with non-DNS-over-TLS servers is increased, by automatically turning off DNS-over-TLS servers in this case. This option defines a per-interface setting for
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+resolved.conf">resolved.conf</A></B>(5)'s global
<I>DNSOverTLS=</I>
option. Defaults to false. This setting is read by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-resolved.service">systemd-resolved.service</A></B>(8).
</DL>

<P>

<I>DNSSEC=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="37"><DD>
Takes a boolean. or
&quot;allow-downgrade&quot;. When true, enables
m[blue]<B>DNSSEC</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT>
DNS validation support on the link. When set to
&quot;allow-downgrade&quot;, compatibility with non-DNSSEC capable networks is increased, by automatically turning off DNSSEC in this case. This option defines a per-interface setting for
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+resolved.conf">resolved.conf</A></B>(5)'s global
<I>DNSSEC=</I>
option. Defaults to false. This setting is read by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-resolved.service">systemd-resolved.service</A></B>(8).
</DL>

<P>

<I>DNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="38"><DD>
A space-separated list of DNSSEC negative trust anchor domains. If specified and DNSSEC is enabled, look-ups done via the interface's DNS server will be subject to the list of negative trust anchors, and not require authentication for the specified domains, or anything below it. Use this to disable DNSSEC authentication for specific private domains, that cannot be proven valid using the Internet DNS hierarchy. Defaults to the empty list. This setting is read by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-resolved.service">systemd-resolved.service</A></B>(8).
</DL>

<P>

<I>LLDP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="39"><DD>
Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet reception. LLDP is a link-layer protocol commonly implemented on professional routers and bridges which announces which physical port a system is connected to, as well as other related data. Accepts a boolean or the special value
&quot;routers-only&quot;. When true, incoming LLDP packets are accepted and a database of all LLDP neighbors maintained. If
&quot;routers-only&quot;
is set only LLDP data of various types of routers is collected and LLDP data about other types of devices ignored (such as stations, telephones and others). If false, LLDP reception is disabled. Defaults to
&quot;routers-only&quot;. Use
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+networkctl">networkctl</A></B>(1)
to query the collected neighbor data. LLDP is only available on Ethernet links. See
<I>EmitLLDP=</I>
below for enabling LLDP packet emission from the local system.
</DL>

<P>

<I>EmitLLDP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="40"><DD>
Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet emission. Accepts a boolean parameter or the special values
&quot;nearest-bridge&quot;,
&quot;non-tpmr-bridge&quot;
and
&quot;customer-bridge&quot;. Defaults to false, which turns off LLDP packet emission. If not false, a short LLDP packet with information about the local system is sent out in regular intervals on the link. The LLDP packet will contain information about the local host name, the local machine ID (as stored in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+machine-id">machine-id</A></B>(5)) and the local interface name, as well as the pretty hostname of the system (as set in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+machine-info">machine-info</A></B>(5)). LLDP emission is only available on Ethernet links. Note that this setting passes data suitable for identification of host to the network and should thus not be enabled on untrusted networks, where such identification data should not be made available. Use this option to permit other systems to identify on which interfaces they are connected to this system. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets. The
&quot;nearest-bridge&quot;
setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge,
&quot;non-tpmr-bridge&quot;
permits propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and
&quot;customer-bridge&quot;
permits propagation until a customer bridge is reached. For details about these concepts, see
m[blue]<B>IEEE 802.1AB-2016</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[6]</FONT>. Note that configuring this setting to true is equivalent to
&quot;nearest-bridge&quot;, the recommended and most restricted level of propagation. See
<I>LLDP=</I>
above for an option to enable LLDP reception.
</DL>

<P>

<I>BindCarrier=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="41"><DD>
A link name or a list of link names. When set, controls the behavior of the current link. When all links in the list are in an operational down state, the current link is brought down. When at least one link has carrier, the current interface is brought up.
</DL>

<P>

<I>Address=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="42"><DD>
A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length, separated by a
&quot;/&quot;
character. Specify this key more than once to configure several addresses. The format of the address must be as described in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+inet_pton">inet_pton</A></B>(3). This is a short-hand for an [Address] section only containing an Address key (see below). This option may be specified more than once.
<P>
If the specified address is
&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;
(for IPv4) or
&quot;::&quot;
(for IPv6), a new address range of the requested size is automatically allocated from a system-wide pool of unused ranges. Note that the prefix length must be equal or larger than 8 for IPv4, and 64 for IPv6. The allocated range is checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration files to avoid address range conflicts. The default system-wide pool consists of 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6. This functionality is useful to manage a large number of dynamically created network interfaces with the same network configuration and automatic address range assignment.
</DL>

<P>

<I>Gateway=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="43"><DD>
The gateway address, which must be in the format described in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+inet_pton">inet_pton</A></B>(3). This is a short-hand for a [Route] section only containing a Gateway key. This option may be specified more than once.
</DL>

<P>

<I>DNS=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="44"><DD>
A DNS server address, which must be in the format described in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+inet_pton">inet_pton</A></B>(3). This option may be specified more than once. This setting is read by

</DL>

<P>

<I>Domains=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="45"><DD>
A whitespace-separated list of domains which should be resolved using the DNS servers on this link. Each item in the list should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde (&quot;~&quot;). The domains with the prefix are called &quot;routing-only domains&quot;. The domains without the prefix are called &quot;search domains&quot; and are first used as search suffixes for extending single-label host names (host names containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a single-label host name is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved.
<P>
Both &quot;search&quot; and &quot;routing-only&quot; domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for host names ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any &quot;search domains&quot; are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface.
<P>
The &quot;routing-only&quot; domain
&quot;~.&quot;
(the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available.
<P>
This setting is read by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-resolved.service">systemd-resolved.service</A></B>(8). &quot;Search domains&quot; correspond to the
<I>domain</I>
and
<I>search</I>
entries in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+resolv.conf">resolv.conf</A></B>(5). Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name servers limited to a specific link.
</DL>

<P>

<I>DNSDefaultRoute=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="46"><DD>
Takes a boolean argument. If true, this link's configured DNS servers are used for resolving domain names that do not match any link's configured
<I>Domains=</I>
setting. If false, this link's configured DNS servers are never used for such domains, and are exclusively used for resolving names that match at least one of the domains configured on this link. If not specified defaults to an automatic mode: queries not matching any link's configured domains will be routed to this link if it has no routing-only domains configured.
</DL>

<P>

<I>NTP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="47"><DD>
An NTP server address. This option may be specified more than once. This setting is read by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-timesyncd.service">systemd-timesyncd.service</A></B>(8).
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPForward=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="48"><DD>
Configures IP packet forwarding for the system. If enabled, incoming packets on any network interface will be forwarded to any other interfaces according to the routing table. Takes a boolean, or the values
&quot;ipv4&quot;
or
&quot;ipv6&quot;, which only enable IP packet forwarding for the specified address family. This controls the
net.ipv4.ip_forward
and
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding
sysctl options of the network interface (see
m[blue]<B>ip-sysctl.txt</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[7]</FONT>
for details about sysctl options). Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.
<P>
Note: this setting controls a global kernel option, and does so one way only: if a network that has this setting enabled is set up the global setting is turned on. However, it is never turned off again, even after all networks with this setting enabled are shut down again.
<P>
To allow IP packet forwarding only between specific network interfaces use a firewall.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPMasquerade=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="49"><DD>
Configures IP masquerading for the network interface. If enabled, packets forwarded from the network interface will be appear as coming from the local host. Takes a boolean argument. Implies
<I>IPForward=ipv4</I>. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6PrivacyExtensions=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="50"><DD>
Configures use of stateless temporary addresses that change over time (see
m[blue]<B>RFC 4941</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[8]</FONT>, Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6). Takes a boolean or the special values
&quot;prefer-public&quot;
and
&quot;kernel&quot;. When true, enables the privacy extensions and prefers temporary addresses over public addresses. When
&quot;prefer-public&quot;, enables the privacy extensions, but prefers public addresses over temporary addresses. When false, the privacy extensions remain disabled. When
&quot;kernel&quot;, the kernel's default setting will be left in place. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6AcceptRA=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="51"><DD>
Takes a boolean. Controls IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) reception support for the interface. If true, RAs are accepted; if false, RAs are ignored. When RAs are accepted, they may trigger the start of the DHCPv6 client if the relevant flags are set in the RA data, or if no routers are found on the link. The default is to disable RA reception for bridge devices or when IP forwarding is enabled, and to enable it otherwise. Cannot be enabled on bond devices and when link local adressing is disabled.
<P>
Further settings for the IPv6 RA support may be configured in the
&quot;[IPv6AcceptRA]&quot;
section, see below.
<P>
Also see
m[blue]<B>ip-sysctl.txt</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[7]</FONT>
in the kernel documentation regarding
&quot;accept_ra&quot;, but note that systemd's setting of
<B>1</B>
(i.e. true) corresponds to kernel's setting of
<B>2</B>.
<P>
Note that kernel's implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is always disabled, regardless of this setting. If this option is enabled, a userspace implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is used, and the kernel's own implementation remains disabled, since
<B>systemd-networkd</B>
needs to know all details supplied in the advertisements, and these are not available from the kernel if the kernel's own implementation is used.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6DuplicateAddressDetection=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="52"><DD>
Configures the amount of IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) probes to send. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6HopLimit=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="53"><DD>
Configures IPv6 Hop Limit. For each router that forwards the packet, the hop limit is decremented by 1. When the hop limit field reaches zero, the packet is discarded. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv4ProxyARP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="54"><DD>
Takes a boolean. Configures proxy ARP for IPv4. Proxy ARP is the technique in which one host, usually a router, answers ARP requests intended for another machine. By &quot;faking&quot; its identity, the router accepts responsibility for routing packets to the &quot;real&quot; destination. (see
m[blue]<B>RFC 1027</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[9]</FONT>. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6ProxyNDP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="55"><DD>
Takes a boolean. Configures proxy NDP for IPv6. Proxy NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is a technique for IPv6 to allow routing of addresses to a different destination when peers expect them to be present on a certain physical link. In this case a router answers Neighbour Advertisement messages intended for another machine by offering its own MAC address as destination. Unlike proxy ARP for IPv4, it is not enabled globally, but will only send Neighbour Advertisement messages for addresses in the IPv6 neighbor proxy table, which can also be shown by
<B>ip -6 neighbour show proxy</B>. systemd-networkd will control the per-interface `proxy_ndp` switch for each configured interface depending on this option. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6ProxyNDPAddress=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="56"><DD>
An IPv6 address, for which Neighbour Advertisement messages will be proxied. This option may be specified more than once. systemd-networkd will add the
<B>IPv6ProxyNDPAddress=</B>
entries to the kernel's IPv6 neighbor proxy table. This option implies
<B>IPv6ProxyNDP=yes</B>
but has no effect if
<B>IPv6ProxyNDP</B>
has been set to false. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6PrefixDelegation=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="57"><DD>
Whether to enable or disable Router Advertisement sending on a link. Allowed values are
&quot;static&quot;
which distributes prefixes as defined in the
&quot;[IPv6PrefixDelegation]&quot;
and any
&quot;[IPv6Prefix]&quot;
sections,
&quot;dhcpv6&quot;
which requests prefixes using a DHCPv6 client configured for another link and any values configured in the
&quot;[IPv6PrefixDelegation]&quot;
section while ignoring all static prefix configuration sections,
&quot;yes&quot;
which uses both static configuration and DHCPv6, and
&quot;false&quot;
which turns off IPv6 prefix delegation altogether. Defaults to
&quot;false&quot;. See the
&quot;[IPv6PrefixDelegation]&quot;
and the
&quot;[IPv6Prefix]&quot;
sections for more configuration options.
</DL>

<P>

<I>IPv6MTUBytes=</I>

</DL>

<P>

<I>IgnoreCarrierLoss=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="71"><DD>
Takes a boolean. Allows networkd to retain both the static and dynamic configuration of the interface even if its carrier is lost. When unset, the value specified with

<DL COMPACT><DT id="77"><DD>
An address label.
</DL>

<P>

<I>PreferredLifetime=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="78"><DD>
Allows the default &quot;preferred lifetime&quot; of the address to be overridden. Only three settings are accepted:
&quot;forever&quot;
or
&quot;infinity&quot;
which is the default and means that the address never expires, and
&quot;0&quot;
which means that the address is considered immediately &quot;expired&quot; and will not be used, unless explicitly requested. A setting of PreferredLifetime=0 is useful for addresses which are added to be used only by a specific application, which is then configured to use them explicitly.
</DL>

<P>

<I>Scope=</I>

<P>

<I>InitialAdvertisedReceiveWindow=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="118"><DD>
The TCP initial advertised receive window is the amount of receive data (in bytes) that can initially be buffered at one time on a connection. The sending host can send only that amount of data before waiting for an acknowledgment and window update from the receiving host. Takes a size in bytes between 1 and 4294967295 (2^32 - 1). The usual suffixes K, M, G are supported and are understood to the base of 1024. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

</DL>

<P>

<I>RoutesToDNS=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="126"><DD>
When true, the routes to the DNS servers received from the DHCP server will be configured. When

<I>UseNTP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="127"><DD>
When true (the default), the NTP servers received from the DHCP server will be used by systemd-timesyncd and take precedence over any statically configured ones.
</DL>

<P>

<I>UseSIP=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="128"><DD>
When true (the default), the SIP servers received from the DHCP server will be saved at the state files and can be read via

function.
</DL>

<P>

<I>UseMTU=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="129"><DD>
When true, the interface maximum transmission unit from the DHCP server will be used on the current link. If

is set, then this setting is ignored. Defaults to false.
</DL>

<P>

<I>Anonymize=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="130"><DD>
Takes a boolean. When true, the options sent to the DHCP server will follow the
m[blue]<B>RFC 7844</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[16]</FONT>
(Anonymity Profiles for DHCP Clients) to minimize disclosure of identifying information. Defaults to false.
<P>
This option should only be set to true when

is set to
&quot;random&quot;
(see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+systemd.link">systemd.link</A></B>(5)).
<P>
Note that this configuration will overwrite others. In concrete, the following variables will be ignored:

<I>ClientIdentifier=</I>,
<I>UseRoutes=</I>,
<I>UseMTU=</I>,
<I>VendorClassIdentifier=</I>,
<I>UseTimezone=</I>.
<P>
With this option enabled DHCP requests will mimic those generated by Microsoft Windows, in order to reduce the ability to fingerprint and recognize installations. This means DHCP request sizes will grow and lease data will be more comprehensive than normally, though most of the requested data is not actually used.
</DL>

<P>

<I>SendHostname=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="131"><DD>
When true (the default), the machine's hostname will be sent to the DHCP server. Note that the machine's hostname must consist only of 7-bit ASCII lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, and be formatted as a valid DNS domain name. Otherwise, the hostname is not sent even if this is set to true.
</DL>

<P>

<I>UseHostname=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="132"><DD>
When true (the default), the hostname received from the DHCP server will be set as the transient hostname of the system.
</DL>

<P>

<I>Hostname=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="133"><DD>
Use this value for the hostname which is sent to the DHCP server, instead of machine's hostname. Note that the specified hostname must consist only of 7-bit ASCII lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, and be formatted as a valid DNS domain name.
</DL>

<P>

<I>UseDomains=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="134"><DD>
Takes a boolean, or the special value
&quot;route&quot;. When true, the domain name received from the DHCP server will be used as DNS search domain over this link, similar to the effect of the
<B>Domains=</B>
setting. If set to
&quot;route&quot;, the domain name received from the DHCP server will be used for routing DNS queries only, but not for searching, similar to the effect of the
<B>Domains=</B>
setting when the argument is prefixed with
&quot;~&quot;. Defaults to true on Ubuntu.
<P>
It is recommended to enable this option only on trusted networks, as setting this affects resolution of all host names, in particular of single-label names. It is generally safer to use the supplied domain only as routing domain, rather than as search domain, in order to not have it affect local resolution of single-label names.
<P>
When set to true, this setting corresponds to the
<B>domain</B>
option in

</DL>

<P>

<I>UseRoutes=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="135"><DD>
When true (the default), the static routes will be requested from the DHCP server and added to the routing table with a metric of 1024, and a scope of &quot;global&quot;, &quot;link&quot; or &quot;host&quot;, depending on the route's destination and gateway. If the destination is on the local host, e.g., 127.x.x.x, or the same as the link's own address, the scope will be set to &quot;host&quot;. Otherwise if the gateway is null (a direct route), a &quot;link&quot; scope will be used. For anything else, scope defaults to &quot;global&quot;.
</DL>

<P>

<I>UseGateway=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="136"><DD>
When true, the gateway will be requested from the DHCP server and added to the routing table with a metric of 1024, and a scope of &quot;link&quot;. When unset, the value specified with
<B>UseRoutes=</B>
is used.
</DL>

<P>

<I>UseTimezone=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="137"><DD>
When true, the timezone received from the DHCP server will be set as timezone of the local system. Defaults to
&quot;no&quot;.
</DL>

<P>

<I>ClientIdentifier=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="138"><DD>
The DHCPv4 client identifier to use. Takes one of
&quot;mac&quot;,
&quot;duid&quot;
or
&quot;duid-only&quot;. If set to
&quot;mac&quot;, the MAC address of the link is used. If set to
&quot;duid&quot;, an RFC4361-compliant Client ID, which is the combination of IAID and DUID (see below), is used. If set to
&quot;duid-only&quot;, only DUID is used, this may not be RFC compliant, but some setups may require to use this. Defaults to

The vendor class identifier used to identify vendor type and configuration.
</DL>

<P>

<I>UserClass=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="140"><DD>
A DHCPv4 client can use UserClass option to identify the type or category of user or applications it represents. The information contained in this option is a string that represents the user class of which the client is a member. Each class sets an identifying string of information to be used by the DHCP service to classify clients. Takes a whitespace-separated list of strings.
</DL>

<P>

<I>MaxAttempts=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="141"><DD>
Specifies how many times the DHCPv4 client configuration should be attempted. Takes a number or

As in the
&quot;[DHCPv4]&quot;
section.
</DL>

<P>

<I>RapidCommit=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="156"><DD>
Takes a boolean. The DHCPv6 client can obtain configuration parameters from a DHCPv6 server through a rapid two-message exchange (solicit and reply). When the rapid commit option is enabled by both the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server, the two-message exchange is used, rather than the default four-method exchange (solicit, advertise, request, and reply). The two-message exchange provides faster client configuration and is beneficial in environments in which networks are under a heavy load. See
m[blue]<B>RFC 3315</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[18]</FONT>

<P>

<I>ForceDHCPv6PDOtherInformation=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="157"><DD>
Takes a boolean that enforces DHCPv6 stateful mode when the 'Other information' bit is set in Router Advertisement messages. By default setting only the 'O' bit in Router Advertisements makes DHCPv6 request network information in a stateless manner using a two-message Information Request and Information Reply message exchange.
m[blue]<B>RFC 7084</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[19]</FONT>, requirement WPD-4, updates this behavior for a Customer Edge router so that stateful DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation is also requested when only the 'O' bit is set in Router Advertisements. This option enables such a CE behavior as it is impossible to automatically distinguish the intention of the 'O' bit otherwise. By default this option is set to 'false', enable it if no prefixes are delegated when the device should be acting as a CE router.

<H2>[DHCPSERVER] SECTION OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

The

<I>DHCPServer=</I>
option described above:
<P>

<I>PoolOffset=</I>, <I>PoolSize=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="165"><DD>
Configures the pool of addresses to hand out. The pool is a contiguous sequence of IP addresses in the subnet configured for the server address, which does not include the subnet nor the broadcast address.
<I>PoolOffset=</I>
takes the offset of the pool from the start of subnet, or zero to use the default value.
<I>PoolSize=</I>
takes the number of IP addresses in the pool or zero to use the default value. By default, the pool starts at the first address after the subnet address and takes up the rest of the subnet, excluding the broadcast address. If the pool includes the server address (the default), this is reserved and not handed out to clients.
</DL>

<P>

<I>DefaultLeaseTimeSec=</I>, <I>MaxLeaseTimeSec=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="166"><DD>
Control the default and maximum DHCP lease time to pass to clients. These settings take time values in seconds or another common time unit, depending on the suffix. The default lease time is used for clients that did not ask for a specific lease time. If a client asks for a lease time longer than the maximum lease time, it is automatically shortened to the specified time. The default lease time defaults to 1h, the maximum lease time to 12h. Shorter lease times are beneficial if the configuration data in DHCP leases changes frequently and clients shall learn the new settings with shorter latencies. Longer lease times reduce the generated DHCP network traffic.
</DL>

<P>

<I>EmitDNS=</I>, <I>DNS=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="167"><DD>
Takes a boolean. Configures whether the DHCP leases handed out to clients shall contain DNS server information. Defaults to
&quot;yes&quot;. The DNS servers to pass to clients may be configured with the
<I>DNS=</I>
option, which takes a list of IPv4 addresses. If the
<I>EmitDNS=</I>
option is enabled but no servers configured, the servers are automatically propagated from an &quot;uplink&quot; interface that has appropriate servers set. The &quot;uplink&quot; interface is determined by the default route of the system with the highest priority. Note that this information is acquired at the time the lease is handed out, and does not take uplink interfaces into account that acquire DNS or NTP server information at a later point. DNS server propagation does not take
/etc/resolv.conf
into account. Also, note that the leases are not refreshed if the uplink network configuration changes. To ensure clients regularly acquire the most current uplink DNS server information, it is thus advisable to shorten the DHCP lease time via
<I>MaxLeaseTimeSec=</I>
described above.
</DL>
