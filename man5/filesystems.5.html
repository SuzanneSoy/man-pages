<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

filesystems - Linux filesystem types: ext, ext2, ext3, ext4, hpfs, iso9660,
JFS, minix, msdos, ncpfs nfs, ntfs, proc, Reiserfs, smb, sysv, umsdos, vfat,
XFS, xiafs,
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

When, as is customary, the
<B>proc</B>

filesystem is mounted on
<I>/proc</I>,

you can find in the file
<I>/proc/filesystems</I>

which filesystems your kernel currently supports;
see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+proc">proc</A></B>(5)

for more details.
There is also a legacy
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+sysfs">sysfs</A></B>(2)

system call (whose availability is controlled by the

<B>CONFIG_SYSFS_SYSCALL</B>

kernel build configuration option since Linux 3.15)
that enables enumeration of the currently available filesystem types
regardless of
<I>/proc</I>

availability and/or sanity.
<P>

If you need a currently unsupported filesystem, insert the corresponding
kernel module or recompile the kernel.
<P>

In order to use a filesystem, you have to
<I>mount</I>

it; see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+mount">mount</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+mount">mount</A></B>(8).

<P>

iThe following list provides a
short description of the available or historically available
filesystems in the Linux kernel.
See the kernel documentation for a comprehensive
description of all options and limitations.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>ext</B>

<DD>
is an elaborate extension of the
<B>minix</B>

filesystem.
It has been completely superseded by the second version
of the extended filesystem
(<B>ext2</B>)

and has been removed from the kernel (in 2.1.21).
<DT id="2"><B>ext2</B>

<DD>
is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux for fixed disks
as well as removable media.
The second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the
extended filesystem
(<B>ext</B>).

See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+ext2">ext2</A></B>(5).

<DT id="3"><B>ext3</B>

<DD>
is a journaling version of the
<B>ext2</B>

filesystem.
It is easy to
switch back and forth between
<B>ext2</B>

and
<B>ext3</B>.

See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+ext3">ext3</A></B>(5).

<DT id="4"><B>ext4</B>

<DD>
is a set of upgrades to
<B>ext3</B>

including substantial performance and
reliability enhancements,
plus large increases in volume, file, and directory size limits.
See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+ext4">ext4</A></B>(5).

<DT id="5"><B>hpfs</B>

<DD>
is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2.
This filesystem is
read-only under Linux due to the lack of available documentation.
<DT id="6"><B>iso9660</B>

<DD>
is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="7"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="8"><B>High Sierra</B>

<DD>
Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the ISO 9660 standard for
CD-ROM filesystems.
It is automatically recognized within the
<B>iso9660</B>

filesystem support under Linux.
<DT id="9"><B>Rock Ridge</B>

<DD>
Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified
by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol.
They are used to further describe the files in the
<B>iso9660</B>

filesystem to a UNIX host, and provide information such as long
filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.
It is automatically recognized within the
<B>iso9660</B>

filesystem support under Linux.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="10"><B>JFS</B>

<DD>
is a journaling filesystem, developed by IBM,
that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.24.
<DT id="11"><B>minix</B>

<DD>
is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the first to run
under Linux.
It has a number of shortcomings, including a 64&nbsp;MB partition size
limit, short filenames, and a single timestamp.
It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks.
<DT id="12"><B>msdos</B>

<DD>
is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers.
<B>msdos</B>

filenames can be no longer than 8 characters, followed by an
optional period and 3 character extension.
<DT id="13"><B>ncpfs</B>

<DD>
is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by
Novell NetWare.
<DT id="14"><DD>
To use
<B>ncpfs</B>,

you need special programs, which can be found at


<DT id="15"><B>nfs</B>

<DD>
is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers.
<DT id="16"><B>ntfs</B>

<DD>
replaces Microsoft Window's FAT filesystems (VFAT, FAT32).
It has reliability, performance, and space-utilization enhancements
plus features like ACLs, journaling, encryption, and so on.
<DT id="17"><B>proc</B>

<DD>
is a pseudo filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data
structures rather than reading and interpreting
<I>/dev/kmem</I>.

In particular, its files do not take disk space.
See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+proc">proc</A></B>(5).

<DT id="18"><B>Reiserfs</B>

<DD>
is a journaling filesystem, designed by Hans Reiser,
that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.1.
<DT id="19"><B>smb</B>

<DD>
is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol, used by
Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Manager.
See


<DT id="20"><B>sysv</B>

<DD>
is an implementation of the SystemV/Coherent filesystem for Linux.
It implements all of Xenix FS, SystemV/386 FS, and Coherent FS.
<DT id="21"><B>umsdos</B>

<DD>
is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux.
It adds capability for
long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and special files
(devices, named pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem, without
sacrificing compatibility with DOS.
<DT id="22"><B>tmpfs</B>

<DD>
is a filesystem whose contents reside in virtual memory.
Since the files on such filesystems typically reside in RAM,
file access is extremely fast.
See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+tmpfs">tmpfs</A></B>(5).

<DT id="23"><B>vfat</B>

<DD>
is an extended FAT filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT.
<B>vfat</B>

adds the capability to use long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem.
<DT id="24"><B>XFS</B>

<DD>
is a journaling filesystem, developed by SGI,
that was integrated into Linux in kernel 2.4.20.
<DT id="25"><B>xiafs</B>

<DD>
was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by
extending the Minix filesystem code.
It provides the basic most
requested features without undue complexity.
The
<B>xiafs</B>

filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained.
It was removed from the kernel in 2.1.21.
