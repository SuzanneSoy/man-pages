autofs - Format of the automounter maps
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The automounter maps are FILE, NIS, NISPLUS or LDAP (including LDAP via SSS)
referred to by the master map of the automounter (see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+auto.master">auto.master</A></B>(5)).

These maps describe how file systems below the mount point of the map
(given in the master map) are to be mounted.  This page describes the
<B>sun</B>

map format; if another map format, other than
<B>amd ,</B>

is specified (e.g. <B>hesiod</B>),
this documentation does not apply.
<P>
Indirect maps, except for the internal hosts map, can be changed on the fly
and the automouter will recognize those changes on the next operation it
performs on that map. Direct maps require a HUP signal be sent to the
daemon to refresh their contents as does the master map.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SUN FORMAT</H2>

This is a description of the text file format.  Other methods of specifying
these files may exist.  All empty lines or lines beginning with # are
ignored. The basic format of one line in such maps is:
<P>

<B>key&nbsp;</B>[<B>-options</B>]&nbsp;<B>location</B>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>key</B>

<DD>
<BR>

For indirect mounts this is the part of the path name between the mount point
and the path into the filesystem when it is mounted. Usually you can think about the
key as a sub-directory name below the autofs managed mount point.
<P>
For direct mounts this is the full path of each mount point. This map is always
associated with the /- mount point in the master map. 
<DT id="2"><B>options</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Zero or more options may be given.  Options can also be given in the 
<B>auto.master</B>

file in which case both values are cumulative (this is a difference
from SunOS).  The options are a list of comma separated options as
customary for the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+mount">mount</A></B>(8)

command.
<P>
There are several special options
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4"><B>-fstype=</B>

<DD>
<BR>

is used to specify a filesystem type if the filesystem is not of the default
NFS type.  This option is processed by the automounter and not by the mount
command.
<DT id="5"><B>-strict</B>

<DD>
<BR>

is used to treat errors when mounting file systems as fatal. This is important when
multiple file systems should be mounted (`multi-mounts'). If this option
is given, no file system is mounted at all if at least one file system
can't be mounted.
<DT id="6"><B>-use-weight-only</B>

<DD>
<BR>

is used to make the weight the sole factor in selecting a server when multiple
servers are present in a map entry.
<DT id="7"><B>-no-use-weight-only</B>

<DD>
<BR>

can be used to negate the option if it is present in the master map entry
for the map but is not wanted for the given mount.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="8"><B>location</B>

<DD>
The location specifies from where the file system is to be mounted.  In the
most cases this will be an NFS volume and the usual notation
<I>host:pathname</I>

is used to indicate the remote filesystem and path to be mounted.  If
the filesystem to be mounted begins with a / (such as local
<I>/dev</I>

entries or smbfs shares) a : needs to be prefixed (e.g. 
<I>:/dev/sda1</I>).

</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

Indirect map:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="9"><DD>


<PRE>
kernel    -ro,soft,intr       <A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org">ftp.kernel.org</A>:/pub/linux
boot      -fstype=ext2        :/dev/hda1
windoze   -fstype=smbfs       ://windoze/c
removable -fstype=ext2        :/dev/hdd
cd        -fstype=iso9660,ro  :/dev/hdc

                              /home myserver.me.org:/home
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
In the first line we have a NFS remote mount of the kernel directory on
<I><A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org">ftp.kernel.org</A></I>.

This is mounted read-only.  The second line mounts an ext2 volume from a
local ide drive.  The third makes a share exported from a Windows
machine available for automounting.  The rest should be fairly
self-explanatory. The last entry (the last three lines) is an example
of a multi-map (see below).
<P>
If you use the automounter for a filesystem without access permissions
(like <B>vfat</B>), users usually can't write on such a filesystem
because it is mounted as user <B>root</B>.
You can solve this problem by passing the option <I>gid=&lt;gid&gt;</I>,
e.g. <I>gid=floppy</I>. The filesystem is then mounted as group
<B>floppy</B> instead of <B>root</B>. Then you can add the users
to this group, and they can write to the filesystem. Here's an
example entry for an autofs map:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="10"><DD>

<H2>FEATURES</H2>

<H3>Map Key Substitution</H3>

An &amp; character in the
<B>location</B>

is expanded to the value of the 
<B>key</B>

field that matched the line (which probably only makes sense together with
a wildcard key).
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Wildcard Key</H3>

A map key of * denotes a wild-card entry. This entry is consulted
if the specified key does not exist in the map.  A typical wild-card
entry looks like this:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="12"><DD>


<PRE>
*         server:/export/home/&amp;
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The special character '&amp;' will be replaced by the provided key.  So,
in the example above, a lookup for the key 'foo' would yield a mount
of server:/export/home/foo.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Variable Substitution</H3>

The following special variables will be substituted in the location
field of an automounter map entry if prefixed with $ as customary
from shell scripts (curly braces can be used to separate the field
name):
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="13"><DD>


<PRE>
ARCH           Architecture (uname -m)
CPU            Processor Type
HOST           Hostname (uname -n)
OSNAME         Operating System (uname -s)
OSREL          Release of OS (uname -r)
OSVERS         Version of OS (uname -v)
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
autofs provides additional variables that are set based on the
user requesting the mount:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="14"><DD>


<PRE>
USER           The user login name
UID            The user login ID
GROUP          The user group name
GID            The user group ID
HOME           The user home directory
SHOST          Short hostname (domain part removed if present)
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
If a program map is used these standard environment variables will have
a prefix of &quot;AUTOFS_&quot; to prevent interpreted languages like python from
being able to load and execute arbitrary code from a user home directory.

<P>
Additional entries can be defined with the -Dvariable=Value map-option to
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+automount">automount</A></B>(8).

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Executable Maps</H3>

A map can be marked as executable. A
<B>program</B>

map will be called with the key as an argument.  It may
return no lines of output if there's an error, or one or more lines
containing a map entry (with \ quoting line breaks). The map entry
corresponds to what would normally follow a map key.
<P>

An executable map can return an error code to indicate the failure in addition
to no output at all.  All output sent to stderr is logged into the system
logs.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Multiple Mounts</H3>

A
<B>multi-mount map</B>

can be used to name multiple filesystems to mount.  It takes the form:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="15"><DD>


<PRE>
<B>key [ -options ] [[/] location [/relative-mount-point [ -options ] location...]...</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
<P>

This may extend over multiple lines, quoting the line-breaks with `\'.
If present, the per-mountpoint mount-options are appended to the
default mount-options. This behaviour may be overridden by the append_options
configuration setting.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Replicated Server</H3>

A mount location can specify multiple hosts for a location, portentially
with a different export path for the same file system. Historically these
different locations are read-only and provide the same replicated file system.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="16"><DD>


<PRE>
Multiple replicated hosts, same path:
&lt;path&gt; host1,host2,hostn:/path/path

Multiple hosts, some with same path, some with another
&lt;path&gt; host1,host2:/blah host3:/some/other/path

Multiple replicated hosts, different (potentially) paths:
&lt;path&gt; host1:/path/pathA host2:/path/pathB

Multiple weighted, replicated hosts same path:
&lt;path&gt; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+host1">host1</A>(5),<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?6+host2">host2</A>(6),<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+host3">host3</A>(1):/path/path

Multiple weighted, replicated hosts different (potentially) paths:
&lt;path&gt; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+host1">host1</A>(3):/path/pathA <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+host2">host2</A>(5):/path/pathB

Anything else is questionable and unsupported, but these variations will also work:
&lt;path&gt; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+host1">host1</A>(3),host:/blah
</PRE>

</DL>

<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>UNSUPPORTED</H2>

This version of the automounter supports direct maps stored in FILE, NIS, NISPLUS
and LDAP (including LDAP via SSS) only.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AMD FORMAT</H2>

This is a description of the text file format. Other methods of specifying
mount map entries may be required for different map sources.  All empty
lines or lines beginning with # are ignored. The basic format of one
line in such maps is:
<P>

<B>key&nbsp;location-list</B>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="17"><B>key</B>

<DD>
<BR>

A <B>key</B> is a path (or a single path component alone) that may end
in the wildcard key, &quot;*&quot;, or the wildcard key alone and must not begin
with the &quot;/&quot; character.
<DT id="18"><B>location-list</B>

<DD>
Following the <B>key</B> is a mount <B>location-list</B>.
<DT id="19">A <B>location-list</B> list has the following syntax:<DD>
<DT id="20"><B>location[&nbsp;location[&nbsp;...&nbsp;]]&nbsp;[||&nbsp;location[&nbsp;location[&nbsp;...&nbsp;]]</B>

<DD>
</DL>
<P>

A mount <B>location-list</B> can use the cut operator, <B>||</B>, to specify
locations that should be tried if none of the locations to the left of it
where selected for a mount attempt.
<P>
A mount <B>location</B> consists of an optional colon separated list
of <B>selectors</B>, followed by a colon separated list of <B>option:=value</B>
pairs.
<P>
The <B>selectors</B> that may be used return a value or boolean result.
Those that return a value may be to used with the comparison
operators <B>==</B> and <B>!=</B> and those that return a boolean result
may be negated with the <B>!</B>.
<P>
For a <B>location</B> to be selected for a mount attempt all of its <B>selectors</B>
must evaluate to true. If a <B>location</B> is selected for a mount attempt
and succeeds the lookup is completed and returns success. If the mount
attempt fails the procedure continues with the next <B>location</B> until
they have all been tried.
<P>
In addition, some <B>selectors</B> take no arguments, some one argument
and others optionally take two arguments.
<P>
The <B>selectors</B> that take no arguments are:

The full operating system name, if not set in the configuration this selector
has no value.
<DT id="27"><B>vendor</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The operating system vendor name, if not set in the configuration this selector
has the value &quot;unknown&quot;.
<DT id="28"><B>byte</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The endianness of the hardware.
<DT id="29"><B>cluster</B>

<DD>

The name of the local cluster. It has a value only if it is set in the
configuration.
<DT id="30"><B>autodir</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The base path under which external mounts are done if they are needed.
Most mounts are done in place but some can't be and this is the base
path under which those mounts will be done.
<DT id="31"><B>domain</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The local domain name. It is set to the value of the configuration
option <B>sub_domain</B>. If sub_domain is not given in the configuration
it is set to the domain part of the local host name, as given by
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+gethostname">gethostname</A>(2).
<DT id="32"><B>host</B>

<DD>

The local host name, without the domain part, as given by <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+gethostname">gethostname</A>(2).
<DT id="33"><B>hostd</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The full host name. If <B>sub_domain</B> is given in the configuration
this is set to the contatenation of <B>host</B> and <B>sub_domain</B> deperated
by a <B>.</B>. If <B>sub_domain</B> is not set in the configuration the value
of <B>domain</B> is used instead of <B>sub_domain</B>.
<DT id="34"><B>uid</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The numeric value of the uid of the user that first requested the mount. Note
this is usual the same as that used by amd but can be different within autofs.
<DT id="35"><B>gid</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The numeric value of the gid of the user that first requested the mount. Note
this is usual the same as that used by amd but can be different within autofs.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="42"><B>in_network(network) ,  network(network) ,  netnumber(network) ,  wire(network)</B>

<DD>
<BR>

These <B>selectors</B> are all the same. <B>in_network()</B> is the
preferred usage. The <B>network</B> argument is an address (which may include
a subnet mask) or network name. The function compares <B>network</B>
against each interface and returns true if <B>network</B> belongs to
the network the interface is connected to.
<DT id="43"><B>xhost(hostname)</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The <B>xhost()</B> selector compares <B>hostname</B> to the <B>${host}</B>
and if it doesn't match it attempts to lookup the cannonical name
of <B>hostname</B> and compares it to {host} as well.
<DT id="44"><B>exists(filename)</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Returns true if <B>filename</B> exits as determined by <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+lstat">lstat</A>(2).
<DT id="45"><B>true()</B>

<DD>
<BR>

Evaluates to true, the argument is ignored and may be empty.
<DT id="46"><B>false()</B>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="48"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="49"><B>netgrp(netgroup[,hostname])</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The <B>netgrp()</B> selector returns true if hostname is a member of
the netgroup <B>netgroup</B>. If <B>hostname</B> is not given <B>${host}</B>
is used for the comparison.
<DT id="50"><B>netgrpd(netgroup[,hostname])</B>

<DD>
<BR>

The <B>netgrpd()i</B> selector behaves the same as <B>netgrp()</B> except
that if <B>hostname</B> is not given <B>${hostd}</B>, the fully qualified
hostname, is used instead of <B>${host}</B>.

<H2>FEATURES</H2>

<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Key Matching</H3>

The amd parser key matching is unusual.
<P>
The key string to be looked up is constructed by prepending the prefix, if
there is one.
<P>
The resulting relative path string is matched by first trying the sting
itself. If no match is found the last component of the key string is
replaced with the wildcard match character (&quot;*&quot;) and a wildcard match is
attempted. This process continues until a match is found or until the
last match, against the wildcard match key alone, fails to match a map
entry and the key lookup fails.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Macro Usage</H3>

Macros are used a lot in the autofs amd implementation.
<P>
Many of the option values are set as macro variables corresponding to the
option name during the map entry parse. So they may be used in subsequent
option values. Beware though, the order in which option values is not
necessarily left to right so you may get unexpected results.

<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

Example NFS mount map:
<P>

Assuming we have the autofs master map entry:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="70"><DD>


<PRE>
/test     file,amd:/etc/amd.test
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
And the following map in /etc/amd.test:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="71"><DD>


<PRE>
/defaults type:=nfs;rhost:=bilbo
apps      rfs:=/autofs
util      rhost:=zeus;rfs:=/work/util
local     rfs:=/shared;sublink:=local
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
In the first line we have an NFS remote mount of the exported directory
/autofs from host bilbo which would be mounted on /test/apps. Next
another nfs mount for the exported directory /work/util from host zeus.
This would be mounted on /test/util.
<P>
Finally, we have an example of the use of the <B>sublink</B> option. In
this case the filesystem bilbo:/shared would be mounted on a path

<H2>NOTES</H2>

To be able to use IPv6 within autofs maps the package must be build

because the glibc RPC implementation doesn't support IPv6 and is
deprecated so this is not likely to change.
