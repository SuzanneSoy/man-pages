cupsd-logs - cupsd log files (access_log, error_log, and page_log)
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+cupsd">cupsd</A></B>(8)

normally maintains three log files: <I>access_log</I> to track requests that are submitted to the scheduler, <I>error_log</I> to track progress and errors, and <I>page_log</I> to track pages that are printed.
Configuration directives in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+cupsd.conf">cupsd.conf</A></B>(5)

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+cups-files.conf">cups-files.conf</A></B>(5)

control what information is logged and where it is stored.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ACCESS LOG FILE FORMAT</H3>

The <I>access_log</I> file lists each HTTP resource that is accessed by a web browser or client.
Each line is in an extended version of the so-called &quot;Common Log Format&quot; used by many web servers and web reporting tools:
<PRE>

    <I>host group user date-time </I>&quot;<I>method resource version</I>&quot; <I>status bytes
      ipp-operation ipp-status</I>

</PRE>

For example:
<PRE>

    10.0.1.2 - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:28 +0000] &quot;POST / HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 317
      CUPS-Get-Printers successful-ok-ignored-or-substituted-attributes
    localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] &quot;GET /admin HTTP/1.1&quot;
      200 0 - -
    localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] &quot;POST / HTTP/1.1&quot;
      200 157 CUPS-Get-Printers
      successful-ok-ignored-or-substituted-attributes
    localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] &quot;POST / HTTP/1.1&quot;
      200 1411 CUPS-Get-Devices -
    localhost - - [01/Dec/2005:21:50:32 +0000] &quot;GET /admin HTTP/1.1&quot;
      200 6667 - -

</PRE>

The <I>host</I> field will normally only be an IP address unless you have enabled the HostNameLookups directive in the <I>cupsd.conf</I> file or if the IP address corresponds to your local machine.
<P>

The <I>group</I> field always contains &quot;-&quot;.
<P>

The <I>user</I> field is the authenticated username of the requesting user.
If no username and password is supplied for the request then this field contains &quot;-&quot;.
<P>

The <I>date-time</I> field is the date and time of the request in local time and is in the format &quot;[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +ZZZZ]&quot;.
<P>

The <I>method</I> field is the HTTP method used: &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;HEAD&quot;, &quot;OPTIONS&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;, or &quot;PUT&quot;.
&quot;GET&quot; requests are used to get files from the server, both for the web interface and to get configuration and log files.
&quot;HEAD&quot; requests are used to get information about a resource prior to a &quot;GET&quot;.
&quot;OPTIONS&quot; requests are used to upgrade connections to TLS encryption.
&quot;POST&quot; requests are used for web interface forms and IPP requests.
&quot;PUT&quot; requests are used to upload configuration files.
<P>

The <I>resource</I> field is the filename of the requested resource.
<P>

The <I>version</I> field is the HTTP specification version used by the client.
For CUPS clients this will always be &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;.
<P>

The <I>status</I> field contains the HTTP result status of the request, as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2">200<DD>
Successful operation.
<DT id="3">201<DD>
File created/modified successfully.
<DT id="4">304<DD>
The requested file has not changed.
<DT id="5">400<DD>
Bad HTTP request; typically this means that you have a malicious program trying to access your server.
<DT id="6">401<DD>
Unauthorized, authentication (username + password) is required.
<DT id="7">403<DD>
Access is forbidden; typically this means that a client tried to access a file or resource they do not have permission to access.
<DT id="8">404<DD>
The file or resource does not exist.
<DT id="9">405<DD>
URL access method is not allowed; typically this means you have a web browser using your server as a proxy.
<DT id="10">413<DD>
Request too large; typically this means that a client tried to print a file larger than the MaxRequestSize allows.
<DT id="11">426<DD>
Upgrading to TLS-encrypted connection.
<DT id="12">500<DD>
Server error; typically this happens when the server is unable to open/create a file - consult the error_log file for details.
<DT id="13">501<DD>
The client requested encryption but encryption support is not enabled/compiled in.
<DT id="14">505<DD>
HTTP version number not supported; typically this means that you have a malicious program trying to access your server.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

The <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes in the request.
For POST requests the bytes field contains the number of bytes of non-IPP data that is received from the client.
<P>

The <I>ipp-operation</I> field contains either &quot;-&quot; for non-IPP requests or the IPP operation name for POST requests containing an IPP request.
<P>

The <I>ipp-status</I> field contains either &quot;-&quot; for non-IPP requests or the IPP status code name for POST requests containing an IPP response.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ERROR LOG FILE FORMAT</H3>

The <I>error_log</I> file lists messages from the scheduler - errors, warnings, etc. The LogLevel directive in the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+cupsd.conf">cupsd.conf</A></B>(5)

file controls which messages are logged:
<PRE>

    level date-time message

</PRE>

For example:
<PRE>

    I [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] Queued on 'DeskJet' by 'mike'.
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[0]=&quot;DeskJet&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[1]=&quot;1&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[2]=&quot;mike&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[3]=&quot;myjob&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[4]=&quot;1&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[5]=&quot;media=
      na_letter_8.5x11in sides=one-sided&quot;
    D [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] [Job 1] argv[6]=&quot;/var/spool/cups/
      d000001-001&quot;
    I [20/May/1999:19:21:02 +0000] [Job 2] Queued on 'DeskJet' by 'mike'.
    I [20/May/1999:19:22:24 +0000] [Job 2] Canceled by 'mike'.

</PRE>

The <I>level</I> field contains the type of message:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="15">A<DD>
Alert message (LogLevel alert)
<DT id="16">C<DD>
Critical error message (LogLevel crit)
<DT id="17">D<DD>
Debugging message (LogLevel debug)
<DT id="18">d<DD>
Detailed debugging message (LogLevel debug2)
<DT id="19">E<DD>
Normal error message (LogLevel error)
<DT id="20">I<DD>

<DT id="23">X<DD>
Emergency error message (LogLevel emerg)
</DL>
<P>

The <I>date-time</I> field contains the date and time of when the page started printing. The format of this field is identical to the data-time field in the <I>access_log</I> file.
<P>

The <I>message</I> field contains a free-form textual message.
Messages from job filters are prefixed with &quot;[Job NNN]&quot; where &quot;NNN&quot; is the job ID.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>PAGE LOG FILE FORMAT</H3>

The <I>page_log</I> file lists the total number of pages (sheets) that are printed.
By default, each line contains the following information:
<PRE>

    <I>printer user job-id date-time </I><B>total </B><I>num-sheets job-billing
      job-originating-host-name job-name media sides</I>

</PRE>

For example the entry for a two page job called &quot;myjob&quot; might look like:
<PRE>

    DeskJet root 1 [20/May/1999:19:21:06 +0000] total 2 acme-123
      localhost myjob na_letter_8.5x11in one-sided
