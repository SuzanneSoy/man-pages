NetworkManager.conf - NetworkManager configuration file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf,
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/<I>name</I>.conf,
/run/NetworkManager/conf.d/<I>name</I>.conf,
/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/<I>name</I>.conf,
/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

NetworkManager.conf
is the configuration file for NetworkManager. It is used to set up various aspects of NetworkManager's behavior. The location of the main file and configuration directories may be changed through use of the
<B>--config</B>,
<B>--config-dir</B>,
<B>--system-config-dir</B>, and
<B>--intern-config</B>
argument for NetworkManager, respectively.
<P>

If a default
NetworkManager.conf
is provided by your distribution's packages, you should not modify it, since your changes may get overwritten by package updates. Instead, you can add additional
.conf
files to the
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d
directory. These will be read in order, with later files overriding earlier ones. Packages might install further configuration snippets to
/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d. This directory is parsed first, even before
NetworkManager.conf. Scripts can also put per-boot configuration into
/run/NetworkManager/conf.d. This directory is parsed second, also before
NetworkManager.conf. The loading of a file
/run/NetworkManager/conf.d/<I>name</I>.conf
can be prevented by adding a file
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/<I>name</I>.conf. Likewise, a file
/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/<I>name</I>.conf
can be shadowed by putting a file of the same name to either
/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d
or
/run/NetworkManager/conf.d.
<P>

NetworkManager can overwrite certain user configuration options via D-Bus or other internal operations. In this case it writes those changes to
/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf. This file is not intended to be modified by the user, but it is read last and can shadow user configuration from
NetworkManager.conf.
<P>

Certain settings from the configuration can be reloaded at runtime either by sending SIGHUP signal or via D-Bus' Reload call.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILE FORMAT</H2>

<P>

The configuration file format is so-called key file (sort of ini-style format). It consists of sections (groups) of key-value pairs. Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments. Sections are started by a header line containing the section enclosed in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next section or the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.
<P>

For keys that take a list of devices as their value, you can specify devices by their MAC addresses or interface names, or &quot;*&quot; to specify all devices. See
the section called "Device List Format"
below.
<P>

Minimal system settings configuration file looks like this:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>



<PRE>
[main]
plugins=keyfile
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>

As an extension to the normal keyfile format, you can also append a value to a previously-set list-valued key by doing:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>



<PRE>
plugins+=another-plugin
plugins-=remove-me
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MAIN SECTION</H2>

<P>

<I>plugins</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3"><DD>
Lists system settings plugin names separated by ','. These plugins are used to read and write system-wide connection profiles. When multiple plugins are specified, the connections are read from all listed plugins. When writing connections, the plugins will be asked to save the connection in the order listed here; if the first plugin cannot write out that connection type (or can't write out any connections) the next plugin is tried, etc. If none of the plugins can save the connection, an error is returned to the user.
<P>
The default value and the number of available plugins is distro-specific. See
the section called "PLUGINS"
below for the available plugins. Note that NetworkManager's native
keyfile
plugin is always appended to the end of this list (if it doesn't already appear earlier in the list).
</DL>

<P>

<I>monitor-connection-files</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="4"><DD>
This setting is deprecated and has no effect.
</DL>

<P>

<I>auth-polkit</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="5"><DD>
Whether the system uses PolicyKit for authorization. If
true, non-root requests are authorized using PolicyKit. Requests from root (user ID zero) are always granted without asking PolicyKit. If
false, all requests will be allowed and PolicyKit is not used. If set to
root-only
PolicyKit is not used and all requests except root are denied. The default value is
true.
</DL>

<P>

<I>dhcp</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="6"><DD>
This key sets up what DHCP client NetworkManager will use. Allowed values are
dhclient,
dhcpcd, and
internal. The
dhclient
and
dhcpcd
options require the indicated clients to be installed. The
internal
option uses a built-in DHCP client which is not currently as featureful as the external clients.
<P>
If this key is missing, it defaults to
internal. It the chosen plugin is not available, clients are looked for in this order:
dhclient,
dhcpcd,
internal.
</DL>

<P>

<I>no-auto-default</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="7"><DD>
Specify devices for which NetworkManager shouldn't create default wired connection (Auto eth0). By default, NetworkManager creates a temporary wired connection for any Ethernet device that is managed and doesn't have a connection configured. List a device in this option to inhibit creating the default connection for the device. May have the special value
*
to apply to all devices.
<P>
When the default wired connection is deleted or saved to a new persistent connection by a plugin, the device is added to a list in the file
/var/lib/NetworkManager/no-auto-default.state
to prevent creating the default connection for that device again.
<P>
See
the section called "Device List Format"
for the syntax how to specify a device.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="8"><DD>



<PRE>
no-auto-default=00:22:68:5c:5d:c4,00:1e:65:ff:aa:ee
no-auto-default=eth0,eth1
no-auto-default=*
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
</DL>

<P>

<I>ignore-carrier</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="9"><DD>
This setting is deprecated for the per-device setting
ignore-carrier
which overwrites this setting if specified (See
<I>ignore-carrier</I>). Otherwise, it is a list of matches to specify for which device carrier should be ignored. See
the section called "Device List Format"
for the syntax how to specify a device. Note that master types like bond, bridge, and team ignore carrier by default. You can however revert that default using the &quot;except:&quot; specifier (or better, use the per-device setting instead of the deprecated setting).
</DL>

<P>

<I>assume-ipv6ll-only</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="10"><DD>
Specify devices for which NetworkManager will try to generate a connection based on initial configuration when the device only has an IPv6 link-local address.
<P>
See
the section called "Device List Format"
for the syntax how to specify a device.
</DL>

<P>

<I>configure-and-quit</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="11"><DD>
When set to 'true', NetworkManager quits after performing initial network configuration but spawns small helpers to preserve DHCP leases and IPv6 addresses. This is useful in environments where network setup is more or less static or it is desirable to save process time but still handle some dynamic configurations. When this option is
true, network configuration for Wi-Fi, WWAN, Bluetooth, ADSL, and PPPoE interfaces cannot be preserved due to their use of external services, and these devices will be deconfigured when NetworkManager quits even though other interface's configuration may be preserved. Also, to preserve DHCP addresses the 'dhcp' option must be set to 'internal'. The default value of the 'configure-and-quit' option is 'false', meaning that NetworkManager will continue running after initial network configuration and continue responding to system and hardware events, D-Bus requests, and user commands.
</DL>

<P>

<I>hostname-mode</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="12"><DD>
Set the management mode of the hostname. This parameter will affect only the transient hostname. If a valid static hostname is set, NetworkManager will skip the update of the hostname despite the value of this option. An hostname empty or equal to 'localhost', 'localhost6', 'localhost.localdomain' or 'localhost6.localdomain' is considered invalid.
<P>
default: NetworkManager will update the hostname with the one provided via DHCP on the main connection (the one with a default route). If not present, the hostname will be updated to the last one set outside NetworkManager. If it is not valid, NetworkManager will try to recover the hostname from the reverse lookup of the IP address of the main connection. If this fails too, the hostname will be set to 'localhost.localdomain'.
<P>
dhcp: NetworkManager will update the transient hostname only with information coming from DHCP. No fallback nor reverse lookup will be performed, but when the dhcp connection providing the hostname is deactivated, the hostname is reset to the last hostname set outside NetworkManager or 'localhost' if none valid is there.
<P>
none: NetworkManager will not manage the transient hostname and will never set it.
</DL>

<P>

<I>dns</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="13"><DD>
Set the DNS processing mode.
<P>
If the key is unspecified,
default
is used, unless
/etc/resolv.conf
is a symlink to
/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf,
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf,
/lib/systemd/resolv.conf
or
/usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf. In that case,
systemd-resolved
is chosen automatically.
<P>
default: NetworkManager will update
/etc/resolv.conf
to reflect the nameservers provided by currently active connections.
<P>
dnsmasq: NetworkManager will run dnsmasq as a local caching nameserver, using &quot;Conditional Forwarding&quot; if you are connected to a VPN, and then update
resolv.conf
to point to the local nameserver. It is possible to pass custom options to the dnsmasq instance by adding them to files in the &quot;/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/&quot; directory. Note that when multiple upstream servers are available, dnsmasq will initially contact them in parallel and then use the fastest to respond, probing again other servers after some time. This behavior can be modified passing the 'all-servers' or 'strict-order' options to dnsmasq (see the manual page for more details).
<P>
systemd-resolved: NetworkManager will push the DNS configuration to systemd-resolved
<P>
unbound: NetworkManager will talk to unbound and dnssec-triggerd, using &quot;Conditional Forwarding&quot; with DNSSEC support.
/etc/resolv.conf
will be managed by dnssec-trigger daemon.
<P>
none: NetworkManager will not modify resolv.conf. This implies
rc-manager&nbsp;unmanaged
<P>
Note that the plugins
dnsmasq,
systemd-resolved
and
unbound
are caching local nameservers. Hence, when NetworkManager writes
/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf
and
/etc/resolv.conf
(according to
rc-manager
setting below), the name server there will be localhost only. NetworkManager also writes a file
/run/NetworkManager/no-stub-resolv.conf
that contains the original name servers pushed to the DNS plugin.
<P>
When using
dnsmasq
and
systemd-resolved
per-connection added dns servers will always be queried using the device the connection has been activated on.
</DL>

<P>

<I>rc-manager</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="14"><DD>
Set the
resolv.conf
management mode. The default value depends on NetworkManager build options, and this version of NetworkManager was build with a default of &quot;symlink&quot;. Regardless of this setting, NetworkManager will always write resolv.conf to its runtime state directory
/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf.
<P>
symlink: If
/etc/resolv.conf
is a regular file, NetworkManager will replace the file on update. If
/etc/resolv.conf
is instead a symlink, NetworkManager will leave it alone. Unless the symlink points to the internal file
/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf, in which case the symlink will be updated to emit an inotify notification. This allows the user to conveniently instruct NetworkManager not to manage
/etc/resolv.conf
by replacing it with a symlink.
<P>
file: NetworkManager will write
/etc/resolv.conf
as file. If it finds a symlink to an existing target, it will follow the symlink and update the target instead. In no case will an existing symlink be replaced by a file. Note that older versions of NetworkManager behaved differently and would replace dangling symlinks with a plain file.
<P>
resolvconf: NetworkManager will run resolvconf to update the DNS configuration.
<P>
netconfig: NetworkManager will run netconfig to update the DNS configuration.
<P>
unmanaged: don't touch
/etc/resolv.conf.
<P>
none: deprecated alias for
symlink.
</DL>

<P>

<I>systemd-resolved</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="15"><DD>
Send the connection DNS configuration to
systemd-resolved. Defaults to &quot;true&quot;.
<P>
Note that this setting is complementary to the
<I>dns</I>
setting. You can keep this enabled while using
<I>dns</I>
set to another DNS plugin alongside
systemd-resolved, or
<I>dns</I>
set to
systemd-resolved
to configure the system resolver to use
systemd-resolved.
<P>
If systemd-resolved is enabled, the connectivity check resolves the hostname per-device.
</DL>

<P>

<I>debug</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="16"><DD>
Comma separated list of options to aid debugging. This value will be combined with the environment variable
NM_DEBUG. Currently the following values are supported:
<P>
RLIMIT_CORE: set ulimit -c unlimited to write out core dumps. Beware, that a core dump can contain sensitive information such as passwords or configuration settings.
<P>
fatal-warnings: set g_log_set_always_fatal() to core dump on warning messages from glib. This is equivalent to the --g-fatal-warnings command line option.
</DL>

<P>

<I>autoconnect-retries-default</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="17"><DD>
The number of times a connection activation should be automatically tried before switching to another one. This value applies only to connections that can auto-connect and have a
connection.autoconnect-retries
property set to -1. If not specified, connections will be tried 4 times. Setting this value to 1 means to try activation once, without retry.
</DL>

<P>

<I>slaves-order</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="18"><DD>
This key specifies in which order slave connections are auto-activated on boot or when the master activates them. Allowed values are
name
(order connection by interface name, the default), or
index
(order slaves by their kernel index).
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>KEYFILE SECTION</H2>

<P>

This section contains keyfile-plugin-specific options, and is normally only used when you are not using any other distro-specific plugin.
<P>

<P>

<I>hostname</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="19"><DD>
This key is deprecated and has no effect since the hostname is now stored in
/etc/hostname
or other system configuration files according to build options.
</DL>

<P>

<I>path</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="20"><DD>
The location where keyfiles are read and stored. This defaults to &quot;/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections&quot;.
</DL>

<P>

<I>unmanaged-devices</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="21"><DD>
Set devices that should be ignored by NetworkManager.
<P>
See
the section called "Device List Format"
for the syntax how to specify a device.
<P>
Example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="22"><DD>



<PRE>
unmanaged-devices=interface-name:em4
unmanaged-devices=mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4;interface-name:eth2
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>IFUPDOWN SECTION</H2>

<P>

This section contains ifupdown-specific options and thus only has effect when using the
ifupdown
plugin.
<P>

<P>

<I>managed</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="23"><DD>
If set to
true, then interfaces listed in
/etc/network/interfaces
are managed by NetworkManager. If set to
false, then any interface listed in
/etc/network/interfaces
will be ignored by NetworkManager. Remember that NetworkManager controls the default route, so because the interface is ignored, NetworkManager may assign the default route to some other interface.
<P>
The default value is
false.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LOGGING SECTION</H2>

<P>

This section controls NetworkManager's logging. Any settings here are overridden by the
<B>--log-level</B>
and
<B>--log-domains</B>
command-line options.
<P>

<P>

<I>level</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="24"><DD>
The default logging verbosity level. One of
OFF,
ERR,
WARN,
INFO,
DEBUG,
TRACE. The ERR level logs only critical errors. WARN logs warnings that may reflect operation. INFO logs various informational messages that are useful for tracking state and operations. DEBUG enables verbose logging for debugging purposes. TRACE enables even more verbose logging then DEBUG level. Subsequent levels also log all messages from earlier levels; thus setting the log level to INFO also logs error and warning messages.
</DL>

<P>

<I>domains</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="25"><DD>
The following log domains are available: PLATFORM, RFKILL, ETHER, WIFI, BT, MB, DHCP4, DHCP6, PPP, WIFI_SCAN, IP4, IP6, AUTOIP4, DNS, VPN, SHARING, SUPPLICANT, AGENTS, SETTINGS, SUSPEND, CORE, DEVICE, OLPC, WIMAX, INFINIBAND, FIREWALL, ADSL, BOND, VLAN, BRIDGE, DBUS_PROPS, TEAM, CONCHECK, DCB, DISPATCH, AUDIT, SYSTEMD, VPN_PLUGIN, PROXY.
<P>
In addition, these special domains can be used: NONE, ALL, DEFAULT, DHCP, IP.
<P>
You can specify per-domain log level overrides by adding a colon and a log level to any domain. E.g., &quot;WIFI:DEBUG,WIFI_SCAN:OFF&quot;.

<H3>Sections</H3>

<P>

You can configure multiple
connection
sections, by having different sections with a name that all start with &quot;connection&quot;. Example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="120"><DD>



<PRE>
[connection]
ipv6.ip6-privacy=0
connection.autoconnect-slaves=1
vpn.timeout=120

[connection-wifi-wlan0]
match-device=interface-name:wlan0
ipv4.route-metric=50

[connection-wifi-other]
match-device=type:wifi
ipv4.route-metric=55
ipv6.ip6-privacy=1
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>

The sections within one file are considered in order of appearance, with the exception that the
[connection]
section is always considered last. In the example above, this order is
[connection-wifi-wlan0],
[connection-wlan-other], and
[connection]. When checking for a default configuration value, the sections are searched until the requested value is found. In the example above, &quot;ipv4.route-metric&quot; for wlan0 interface is set to 50, and for all other Wi-Fi typed interfaces to 55. Also, Wi-Fi devices would have IPv6 private addresses enabled by default, but other devices would have it disabled. Note that also &quot;wlan0&quot; gets &quot;ipv6.ip6-privacy=1&quot;, because although the section &quot;[connection-wifi-wlan0]&quot; matches the device, it does not contain that property and the search continues.
<P>

When having different sections in multiple files, sections from files that are read later have higher priority. So within one file the priority of the sections is top-to-bottom. Across multiple files later definitions take precedence.
<P>

The following properties further control how a connection section applies.
<P>

<I>match-device</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="121"><DD>
An optional device spec that restricts when the section applies. See
the section called "Device List Format"
for the possible values.
</DL>

<P>

<I>stop-match</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="122"><DD>
An optional boolean value which defaults to
no. If the section matches (based on
match-device), further sections will not be considered even if the property in question is not present. In the example above, if
[connection-wifi-wlan0]
would have
stop-match
set to
yes, the device
wlan0
would have
ipv6.ip6-privacy
property unspecified. That is, the search for the property would not continue in the connection sections
[connection-wifi-other]
or
[connection].
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DEVICE SECTION</H2>

<P>

Contains per-device persistent configuration.
<P>

Example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="123"><DD>



<PRE>
[device]
match-device=interface-name:eth3
managed=1
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Supported Properties</H3>

<P>

The following properties can be configured per-device.
<P>

<I>managed</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="124"><DD>
Whether the device is managed or not. A device can be marked as managed via udev rules (ENV{NM_UNMANAGED}), or via setting plugins (keyfile.unmanaged-devices). This is yet another way. Note that this configuration can be overruled at runtime via D-Bus. Also, it has higher priority then udev rules.
</DL>

<P>

<I>carrier-wait-timeout</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="125"><DD>
Specify the timeout for waiting for carrier in milliseconds. When the device loses carrier, NetworkManager does not react immediately. Instead, it waits for this timeout before considering the link lost. Also, on startup, NetworkManager considers the device as busy for this time, as long as the device has no carrier. This delays startup-complete signal and NetworkManager-wait-online. Configuring this too high means to block NetworkManager-wait-online longer then necessary. Configuring it too low, means that NetworkManager will declare startup-complete, although carrier is about to come and auto-activation to kick in. The default is 5000 milliseconds.
</DL>

<P>

<I>ignore-carrier</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="126"><DD>
Specify devices for which NetworkManager will (partially) ignore the carrier state. Normally, for device types that support carrier-detect, such as Ethernet and InfiniBand, NetworkManager will only allow a connection to be activated on the device if carrier is present (ie, a cable is plugged in), and it will deactivate the device if carrier drops for more than a few seconds.
<P>
A device with carrier ignored will allow activating connections on that device even when it does not have carrier, provided that the connection uses only statically-configured IP addresses. Additionally, it will allow any active connection (whether static or dynamic) to remain active on the device when carrier is lost.
<P>
Note that the &quot;carrier&quot; property of NMDevices and device D-Bus interfaces will still reflect the actual device state; it's just that NetworkManager will not make use of that information.
<P>
Master types like bond, bridge and team ignore carrier by default, while other device types react on carrier changes by default.
<P>
This setting overwrites the deprecated
main.ignore-carrier
setting above.
</DL>

<P>

<I>wifi.scan-rand-mac-address</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="127"><DD>
Configures MAC address randomization of a Wi-Fi device during scanning. This defaults to
yes
in which case a random, locally-administered MAC address will be used. The setting
wifi.scan-generate-mac-address-mask
allows to influence the generated MAC address to use certain vendor OUIs. If disabled, the MAC address during scanning is left unchanged to whatever is configured. For the configured MAC address while the device is associated, see instead the per-connection setting
wifi.cloned-mac-address.
</DL>

<P>

<I>wifi.backend</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="128"><DD>
Specify the Wi-Fi backend used for the device. Currently supported are
wpa_supplicant
and
iwd
(experimental).
</DL>

<P>

<I>wifi.scan-generate-mac-address-mask</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="129"><DD>
Like the per-connection settings
ethernet.generate-mac-address-mask
and
wifi.generate-mac-address-mask, this allows to configure the generated MAC addresses during scanning. See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+nm-settings">nm-settings</A></B>(5)
for details.
</DL>

<P>

<I>sriov-num-vfs</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="130"><DD>
Specify the number of virtual functions (VF) to enable for a PCI physical device that supports single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV).
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Sections</H3>

<P>

The
[device]
section works the same as the
[connection]
section. That is, multiple sections that all start with the prefix &quot;device&quot; can be specified. The settings &quot;match-device&quot; and &quot;stop-match&quot; are available to match a device section on a device. The order of multiple sections is also top-down within the file and later files overwrite previous settings. See
"Sections" under the section called "CONNECTION SECTION"
for details.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONNECTIVITY SECTION</H2>

<P>

This section controls NetworkManager's optional connectivity checking functionality. This allows NetworkManager to detect whether or not the system can actually access the internet or whether it is behind a captive portal.
<P>

Connectivity checking serves two purposes. For one, it exposes a connectivity state on D-Bus, which other applications may use. For example, Gnome's portal helper uses this as signal to show a captive portal login page. The other use is that default-route of devices without global connectivity get a penalty of +20000 to the route-metric. This has the purpose to give a better default-route to devices that have global connectivity. For example, when being connected to WWAN and to a Wi-Fi network which is behind a captive portal, WWAN still gets preferred until login.
<P>

Note that your distribution might set
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter
to strict filtering. That works badly with per-device connectivity checking, which uses SO_BINDDEVICE to send requests on all devices. A strict rp_filter setting will reject any response and the connectivity check on all but the best route will fail.
<P>

<P>

<I>enabled</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="131"><DD>
Whether connectivity check is enabled. Note that to enable connectivity check, a valid uri must also be configured. The value defaults to true, but since the uri is unset by default, connectivity check may be disabled. The main purpose of this option is to have a single flag to disable connectivity check. Note that this setting can also be set via D-Bus API at runtime. In that case, the value gets stored in
/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf
file.
</DL>

<P>

<I>uri</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="132"><DD>
The URI of a web page to periodically request when connectivity is being checked. This page should return the header &quot;X-NetworkManager-Status&quot; with a value of &quot;online&quot;. Alternatively, its body content should be set to &quot;NetworkManager is online&quot;. The body content check can be controlled by the
response
option. If this option is blank or missing, connectivity checking is disabled.
</DL>

<P>

<I>interval</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="133"><DD>
Specified in seconds; controls how often connectivity is checked when a network connection exists. If set to 0 connectivity checking is disabled. If missing, the default is 300 seconds.
</DL>

<P>

<I>response</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="134"><DD>
If set, controls what body content NetworkManager checks for when requesting the URI for connectivity checking. Note that this only compares that the HTTP response starts with the specifid text, it does not compare the exact string. This behavior might change in the future, so avoid relying on it. If missing, the response defaults to &quot;NetworkManager is online&quot;. If set to empty, the HTTP server is expected to answer with status code 204 or send no data.

<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GLOBAL-DNS SECTION</H2>

<P>

<P>

<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GLOBAL-DNS-DOMAIN SECTIONS</H2>

<P>

Sections with a name starting with the &quot;global-dns-domain-&quot; prefix allow to define global DNS configuration for specific domains. The part of section name after &quot;global-dns-domain-&quot; specifies the domain name a section applies to. More specific domains have the precedence over less specific ones and the default domain is represented by the wildcard &quot;*&quot;. A default domain section is mandatory.
<P>

<P>

<I>servers</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="137"><DD>
A list of addresses of DNS servers to be used for the given domain.
</DL>

<P>

<I>options</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="138"><DD>
A list of domain-specific DNS options. Not used at the moment.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>.CONFIG SECTIONS</H2>

<P>

This is a special section that contains options which apply to the configuration file that contains the option.
<P>

<P>

<I>enable</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="139"><DD>
Defaults to &quot;true&quot;. If &quot;false&quot;, the configuration file will be skipped during loading. Note that the main configuration file
NetworkManager.conf
cannot be disabled.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="140"><DD>



<PRE>
# always skip loading the config file
[.config]
enable=false
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
You can also match against the version of NetworkManager. For example the following are valid configurations:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="141"><DD>



<PRE>
# only load on version 1.0.6
[.config]
enable=nm-version:1.0.6

# load on all versions 1.0.x, but not 1.2.x
[.config]
enable=nm-version:1.0

# only load on versions &gt;= 1.1.6. This does not match
# with version 1.2.0 or 1.4.4. Only the last digit is considered.
[.config]
enable=nm-version-min:1.1.6

# only load on versions &gt;= 1.2. Contrary to the previous
# example, this also matches with 1.2.0, 1.2.10, 1.4.4, etc.
[.config]
enable=nm-version-min:1.2

# Match against the maximum allowed version. The example matches
# versions 1.2.0, 1.2.2, 1.2.4. Again, only the last version digit
# is allowed to be smaller. So this would not match match on 1.1.10.
[.config]
enable=nm-version-max:1.2.6
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
You can also match against the value of the environment variable
NM_CONFIG_ENABLE_TAG, like:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="142"><DD>



<PRE>
# always skip loading the file when running NetworkManager with
# environment variable &quot;NM_CONFIG_ENABLE_TAG=TAG1&quot;
[.config]
enable=env:TAG1
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
More then one match can be specified. The configuration will be enabled if one of the predicates matches (&quot;or&quot;). The special prefix &quot;except:&quot; can be used to negate the match. Note that if one except-predicate matches, the entire configuration will be disabled. In other words, a except predicate always wins over other predicates. If the setting only consists of &quot;except:&quot; matches and none of the negative conditions are satisfied, the configuration is still enabled.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="143"><DD>



<PRE>
# enable the configuration either when the environment variable
# is present or the version is at least 1.2.0.
[.config]
enable=env:TAG2,nm-version-min:1.2

# enable the configuration for version &gt;= 1.2.0, but disable
# it when the environment variable is set to &quot;TAG3&quot;
[.config]

<H2>PLUGINS</H2>

<P>

Settings plugins for reading and writing connection profiles. The number of available plugins is distribution specific.
<P>

<I>keyfile</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="144"><DD>
The
keyfile
plugin is the generic plugin that supports all the connection types and capabilities that NetworkManager has. It writes files out in an .ini-style format in
/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections. See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+nm-settings-keyfile">nm-settings-keyfile</A></B>(5)
for details about the file format.
<P>
The stored connection file may contain passwords, secrets and private keys in plain text, so it will be made readable only to root, and the plugin will ignore files that are readable or writable by any user or group other than root. See &quot;Secret flag types&quot; in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+nm-settings">nm-settings</A></B>(5)
for how to avoid storing passwords in plain text.
<P>
This plugin is always active, and will automatically be used to store any connections that aren't supported by any other active plugin.
</DL>

<P>

<I>ifcfg-rh</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="145"><DD>
This plugin is used on the Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions to read and write configuration from the standard
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
files. It currently supports reading Ethernet, Wi-Fi, InfiniBand, VLAN, Bond, Bridge, and Team connections. Enabling
ifcfg-rh
implicitly enables
ibft
plugin, if it is available. This can be disabled by adding
no-ibft. See
/usr/share/doc/initscripts/sysconfig.txt
and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+nm-settings-ifcfg-rh">nm-settings-ifcfg-rh</A></B>(5)

</DL>

<P>

<I>ifupdown</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="146"><DD>
This plugin is used on the Debian and Ubuntu distributions, and reads Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections from

</DL>

<P>

driver:DRIVER
<DL COMPACT><DT id="157"><DD>
Match the device driver as reported by &quot;nmcli -f GENERAL.DRIVER,GENERAL.DRIVER-VERSION device show&quot;. &quot;DRIVER&quot; must match the driver name exactly and does not support globbing. Optionally, a driver version may be specified separated by '/'. Globbing is supported for the version.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="159"><DD>
Negative match of a device.
SPEC
must be explicitly qualified with a prefix such as
interface-name:. A negative match has higher priority then the positive matches above.
<P>
If there is a list consisting only of negative matches, the behavior is the same as if there is also match-all. That means, if none of all the negative matches is satisfied, the overall result is still a positive match. That means,

SPEC[,;]SPEC
<DL COMPACT><DT id="160"><DD>
Multiple specs can be concatenated with commas or semicolons. The order does not matter as matches are either inclusive or negative (except:), with negative matches having higher priority.
<P>
Backslash is supported to escape the separators ';' and ',', and to express special characters such as newline ('\n'), tabulator ('\t'), whitespace ('\s') and backslash ('\\'). The globbing of interface names cannot be escaped. Whitespace is not a separator but will be trimmed between two specs (unless escaped as '\s').
