sane-artec_eplus48u - SANE backend for the scanner Artec E+ 48U and re-badged models
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>sane-artec_eplus48u</B>

library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides
access to several USB flatbed scanners using the GT6816 chipset like the Artec E+ 48U.
These scanners have a contact image sensor (CIS) and an USB interface.
<P>

A complete list of supported devices can be found on
<I><A HREF="http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html">http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html</A></I>.

<P>

This is ALPHA software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners, keep
your hand at the scanner's plug and unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of
the scan area.
<P>

If you own a scanner other than the ones mentioned on the list that works with this
backend, please let us know this by sending the scanner's exact model name and
the USB vendor and product ids (e.g. from /proc/bus/usb/devices,
sane-find-scanner or syslog) to me. Even if the scanner's name is only
slightly different from the models mentioned above, please let me know.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>KERNEL ISSUES</H2>

If libusb-0.1.6 or later is installed, this section can be skipped. The
scanner should be found by sane-find-scanner without further actions. For
setting permissions and general USB information look at <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+sane-usb">sane-usb</A>(5).
<P>

When you are using the scanner module, a Linux kernel 2.4.12 or newer is
required.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FIRMWARE FILE</H2>

You need a firmware file for your scanner. That's a small file containing
software that will be uploaded to the scanner's memory. For the scanners
mentioned above, it's usually named Artec48.usb or 1200.usb. You can find it on
the installation CD that was provided by the manufacturer, normally in the
directory Win98, WinMe or similar. If the Windows-driver is installed on your
computer, then you can also find the firmware file under
c:\windows\system32\drivers.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

The contents of the
<I>artec_eplus48u.conf</I>

file is a list of usb lines containing vendor and product ids that correspond
to USB scanners. The file can also contain option lines.  Empty lines and
lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  The scanners are
autodetected by
<I>usb vendor_id product_id</I>

statements which are already included into
<I>artec_eplus48u.conf .</I>

&quot;vendor_id&quot; and &quot;product_id&quot; are hexadecimal numbers that identify the
<B>scanner.</B>

<P>

Every usb section can have additional options
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>artecFirmwareFile @DATADIR@/sane/artec_eplus48u/Artec48.usb</B>

<DD>
The path to the firmware file. This option is required.
<DT id="2"><B>redGamma         1.0</B>

<DD>
<DT id="3"><B>greenGamma       1.0</B>

<DD>
<DT id="4"><B>blueGamma        1.0</B>

<DD>
<DT id="5"><B>masterGamma      1.9</B>

<DD>
These are the default gamma values. If you set the &quot;Defaults&quot; option with a frontend,
then the gamma options are reset to the values specified here.
<DT id="6"><B>redOffset        0x28</B>

<DD>
<DT id="7"><B>greenOffset      0x2f</B>

<DD>
<DT id="8"><B>blueOffset       0x2f</B>

<DD>
<DT id="9"><B>redExposure      0xa7</B>

<DD>
<DT id="10"><B>greenExposure    0x116</B>

<DD>
<DT id="11"><B>blueExposure     0xdc</B>

<DD>
These are the default values for offset and exposure time. You can e.g. change them to speed up calibration,
if you don't want to save the calibration data to disk.
<DT id="12"><B>vendorString Artec</B>

<DD>
<DT id="13"><B>modelString E+ 48U</B>

<DD>
By default, the scanner is reported as &quot;Artec E+ 48U&quot;. If you don't like this, e.g.
because you have an Tevion MD 9693, then change the options accordingly.

<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="14"><I>/usr/local/etc/sane.d/artec_eplus48u.conf</I>

<DD>
The backend configuration file (see also description of
<B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

below).
<DT id="15"><I>/usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.a</I>

<DD>
The static library implementing this backend.
<DT id="16"><I>/usr/local/lib/sane/libsane-artec_eplus48u.so</I>

<DD>
The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="17"><B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

<DD>
This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file
is searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in /usr/local/etc/sane.d.  If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories.  For example, setting
<B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;/usr/local/etc/sane.d&quot; being searched (in this order).
<DT id="18"><B>SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U</B>

<DD>
If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  Higher
debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.
<P>
Example:
export SANE_DEBUG_ARTEC_EPLUS48U=3

This backend has been tested on Linux only. If you are using it on a different platform, please
contact us.
<P>

Interpolation with 1200 dpi is weak.
<P>

Support for buttons is missing due to missing support in SANE.
