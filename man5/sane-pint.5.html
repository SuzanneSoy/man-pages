sane-pint - SANE backend for scanners that use the PINT device driver
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>sane-pint</B>

library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that
provides generic access to hand-held and flatbed scanners using the
PINT (PINT Is Not Twain) device driver.  The PINT driver is being
actively developed on the OpenBSD platform, and has been ported to a
few other *nix-like operating systems.
<P>

PINT is designed to provide an
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+ioctl">ioctl</A></B>(2)

interface to many different scanner types.  However, this backend has
only been tested with flatbed single-pass scanners, and more work will
probably be required to get it to use other scanner types
successfully.
<P>

If have successfully used the PINT driver with your scanner, but it
does not work using this SANE backend, please let us know.  To do
this, send a mail with the relevant information for your scanner to
<I><A HREF="mailto:sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net">sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net</A></I>.

<H2>DEVICE NAMES</H2>

This backend expects device names of the form:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
<I>special</I>

</DL>

<P>

Where
<I>special</I>

is the UNIX path-name for the special device that corresponds to the
scanner.  The special device name must be a PINT device or a symlink
to such a device.  For example, under NetBSD or OpenBSD, such a device
name could be
<I>/dev/ss0</I>

or
<I>/dev/scan0</I>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

The contents of the
<I>pint.conf</I>.

file is a list of device names that correspond to PINT
scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown below:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
/dev/scanner
<BR>

# this is a comment
<BR>

/dev/ss1
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3"><I>@CONFIGDIR@/pint.conf</I>

<DD>
The backend configuration file (see also description of
<B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

below).
<DT id="4"><I>@LIBDIR@/libsane-pint.a</I>

<DD>
The static library implementing this backend.
<DT id="5"><I>@LIBDIR@/libsane-pint.so</I>

<DD>
The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="6"><B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

<DD>
This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file
is searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in @CONFIGDIR@.  If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories.  For example, setting
<B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;@CONFIGDIR@&quot; being searched (in this order).
<DT id="7"><B>SANE_DEBUG_PINT</B>

<DD>
If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
levels reduce verbosity.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<P>
There are minor roundoff errors when adjusting the ranges, since
PINT uses units of 1/1200 of an inch, and SANE normally uses
millimeters.  Symptoms of these errors are skewed images.  This should
really be fixed (no pun intended) as soon as possible, but I just
don't know/care enough about fixed-point representation and roundoff
errors to do this correctly.  Workaround: use inches as the scanning
unit, and everything usually works fine.
<P>
The PINT 0.5e interface does not provide a way to determine valid
ranges for DPI, modes, and scan sizes.  So, the SANE backend queries
the PINT device, and dynamically discovers valid ranges by doing a
binary search.  This means that the driver takes longer to initialize
than seems necessary.
<P>
Resetting the scanner does not seem to work (at least not on my HP
ScanJet 4p).  For that reason, the driver sends a SCIOCRESTART, then
gobbles up any remaining input until it hits EOF.
<P>
Not all of the scanners have been identified (i.e. whether they are
flatbed or handheld).
<P>
X and Y resolutions are assumed to be the same.
<P>
No testing has been done on three-pass or handheld scanners, or with
Automatic Document Feeder support.
