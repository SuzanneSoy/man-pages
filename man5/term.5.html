<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

term - format of compiled term file.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>term</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>STORAGE LOCATION</H3>

Compiled terminfo descriptions are placed under the directory <B>/etc/terminfo</B>.
Two configurations are supported (when building the <B>ncurses</B> libraries):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>directory tree</B>

<DD>
A two-level scheme is used to avoid a linear search
of a huge <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> system directory: <B>/etc/terminfo/c/name</B> where
<I>name</I>

is the name of the terminal, and
<I>c</I>

is the first character of
<I>name</I>.

Thus,
<I>act4</I>

can be found in the file <B>/etc/terminfo/a/act4</B>.
Synonyms for the same terminal are implemented by multiple
links to the same compiled file.
<DT id="2"><B>hashed database</B>

<DD>
Using Berkeley database, two types of records are stored:
the terminfo data in the same format as stored in a directory tree with
the terminfo's primary name as a key,
and records containing only aliases pointing to the primary name.
<DT id="3"><DD>
If built to write hashed databases,
<B>ncurses</B> can still read terminfo databases organized as a directory tree,
but cannot write entries into the directory tree.
It can write (or rewrite) entries in the hashed database.
<DT id="4"><DD>
<B>ncurses</B> distinguishes the two cases in the TERMINFO and TERMINFO_DIRS
environment variable by assuming a directory tree for entries that
correspond to an existing directory,
and hashed database otherwise.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>LEGACY STORAGE FORMAT</H3>

The format has been chosen so that it will be the same on all hardware.
An 8 or more bit byte is assumed, but no assumptions about byte ordering
or sign extension are made.
<P>

The compiled file is created with the <B>tic</B> program,
and read by the routine <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3X+setupterm">setupterm</A></B>(3X).
The file is divided into six parts:
the header,
terminal names,
boolean flags,
numbers,
strings,
and
string table.
<P>

The header section begins the file.
This section contains six short integers in the format
described below.
These integers are
<DL COMPACT><DT id="5"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="6">(1) the magic number (octal 0432);<DD>
<DT id="7">(2) the size, in bytes, of the names section;<DD>
<DT id="8">(3) the number of bytes in the boolean section;<DD>
<DT id="9">(4) the number of short integers in the numbers section;<DD>
<DT id="10">(5) the number of offsets (short integers) in the strings section;<DD>
<DT id="11">(6) the size, in bytes, of the string table.<DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

Short integers are stored in two 8-bit bytes.
The first byte contains the least significant 8 bits of the value,
and the second byte contains the most significant 8 bits.
(Thus, the value represented is 256*second+first.)
The value -1 is represented by the two bytes 0377, 0377; other negative
values are illegal.
This value generally
means that the corresponding capability is missing from this terminal.
Note that this format corresponds to the hardware of the <FONT SIZE="-1">VAX</FONT>
and <FONT SIZE="-1">PDP</FONT>-11 (that is, little-endian machines).
Machines where this does not correspond to the hardware must read the
integers as two bytes and compute the little-endian value.
<P>

The terminal names section comes next.
It contains the first line of the terminfo description,
listing the various names for the terminal,
separated by the ``|'' character.
The section is terminated with an <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII NUL</FONT> character.
<P>

The boolean flags have one byte for each flag.
This byte is either 0 or 1 as the flag is present or absent.
The capabilities are in the same order as the file &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/term.h">term.h</A>&gt;.
<P>

Between the boolean section and the number section,
a null byte will be inserted, if necessary,
to ensure that the number section begins on an even byte (this is a
relic of the PDP-11's word-addressed architecture, originally
designed in to avoid IOT traps induced by addressing a word on an
odd byte boundary).
All short integers are aligned on a short word boundary.
<P>

The numbers section is similar to the flags section.
Each capability takes up two bytes,
and is stored as a little-endian short integer.
If the value represented is -1, the capability is taken to be missing.
<P>

The strings section is also similar.
Each capability is stored as a short integer, in the format above.
A value of -1 means the capability is missing.
Otherwise, the value is taken as an offset from the beginning
of the string table.
Special characters in ^X or \c notation are stored in their
interpreted form, not the printing representation.
Padding information $&lt;nn&gt; and parameter information %x are
stored intact in uninterpreted form.
<P>

The final section is the string table.
It contains all the values of string capabilities referenced in
the string section.
Each string is null terminated.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>EXTENDED STORAGE FORMAT</H3>

The previous section describes the conventional terminfo binary format.
With some minor variations of the offsets (see PORTABILITY),
the same binary format is used in all modern UNIX systems.
Each system uses a predefined set of boolean, number or string capabilities.
<P>

The <B>ncurses</B> libraries and applications support
extended terminfo binary format,
allowing users to define capabilities which are loaded at runtime.
This
extension is made possible by using the fact that the other implementations
stop reading the terminfo data when they have reached the end of the size given
in the header.
<B>ncurses</B> checks the size,
and if it exceeds that due to the predefined data,
continues to parse according to its own scheme.
<P>

First, it reads the extended header (5 short integers):
<DL COMPACT><DT id="12"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="13">(1)<DD>
count of extended boolean capabilities
<DT id="14">(2)<DD>
count of extended numeric capabilities
<DT id="15">(3)<DD>
count of extended string capabilities
<DT id="16">(4)<DD>
count of the items in extended string table
<DT id="17">(5)<DD>
size of the extended string table in bytes
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

The count- and size-values for the extended string table
include the extended capability <I>names</I> as well as
extended capability <I>values</I>.
<P>

Using the counts and sizes, <B>ncurses</B> allocates arrays and reads data
for the extended capabilities in the same order as the header information.
<P>

The extended string table contains values for string capabilities.
After the end of these values, it contains the names for each of
the extended capabilities in order, e.g., booleans, then numbers and
finally strings.
<P>

Applications which manipulate terminal data can use the definitions
described in <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3X+term_variables">term_variables</A></B>(3X) which associate the long capability
names with members of a <B>TERMTYPE</B> structure.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>EXTENDED NUMBER FORMAT</H3>

<P>

On occasion, 16-bit signed integers are not large enough.
With <B>ncurses</B> 6.1, a new format was introduced by making a few changes
to the legacy format:

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


a different magic number (octal 01036)

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


changing the type for the <I>number</I> array from signed 16-bit integers
to signed 32-bit integers.
<P>

To maintain compatibility, the library presents the same data structures
to direct users of the <B>TERMTYPE</B> structure as in previous formats.
However, that cannot provide callers with the extended numbers.
The library uses a similar but hidden data structure <B>TERMTYPE2</B>
to provide data for the terminfo functions.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2>

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>setupterm</H3>

<P>

Note that it is possible for
<B>setupterm</B>

to expect a different set of capabilities
than are actually present in the file.
Either the database may have been updated since
<B>setupterm</B>

has been recompiled
(resulting in extra unrecognized entries in the file)
or the program may have been recompiled more recently
than the database was updated
(resulting in missing entries).
The routine
<B>setupterm</B>

must be prepared for both possibilities -
this is why the numbers and sizes are included.
Also, new capabilities must always be added at the end of the lists
of boolean, number, and string capabilities.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Binary format</H3>

<P>

X/Open Curses does not specify a format for the terminfo database.
UNIX System V curses used a directory-tree of binary files,
one per terminal description.
<P>

Despite the consistent use of little-endian for numbers and the otherwise
self-describing format, it is not wise to count on portability of binary
terminfo entries between commercial UNIX versions.
The problem is that there
are at least three versions of terminfo (under HP-UX, AIX, and OSF/1) which
diverged from System V terminfo after SVr1, and have added extension
capabilities to the string table that (in the binary format) collide with
System V and XSI Curses extensions.
See <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+terminfo">terminfo</A></B>(5) for detailed
discussion of terminfo source compatibility issues.
<P>

This implementation is by default compatible with the binary
terminfo format used by Solaris curses,
except in a few less-used details
where it was found that the latter did not match X/Open Curses.
The format used by the other Unix versions
can be matched by building ncurses
with different configuration options.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Magic codes</H3>

<P>

The magic number in a binary terminfo file is the first 16-bits (two bytes).
Besides making it more reliable for the library to check that a file
is terminfo,
utilities such as <B>file</B> also use that to tell what the file-format is.
System V defined more than one magic number,
with 0433, 0435 as screen-dumps (see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+scr_dump">scr_dump</A></B>(5)).
This implementation uses 01036 as a continuation of that sequence,
but with a different high-order byte to avoid confusion.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The TERMTYPE structure</H3>

<P>

Direct access to the <B>TERMTYPE</B> structure is provided for legacy
applications.
Portable applications should use the <B>tigetflag</B> and related functions
described in <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3X+curs_terminfo">curs_terminfo</A></B>(3X) for reading terminal capabilities.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Mixed-case terminal names</H3>

<P>

A small number of terminal descriptions use uppercase characters in
their names.
If the underlying filesystem ignores the difference between
uppercase and lowercase,
<B>ncurses</B> represents the ``first character''
of the terminal name used as
the intermediate level of a directory tree in (two-character) hexadecimal form.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

As an example, here is a description for the Lear-Siegler
ADM-3, a popular though rather stupid early terminal:

<BR>&nbsp;.sp

<BR>&nbsp;.in&nbsp;+4

<PRE>
adm3a|lsi adm3a,
        am,
        cols#80, lines#24,

        cuf1=^L, cup=\E=%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c, cuu1=^K,
        home=^^, ind=^J,

 .sp .in +4
and a hexadecimal dump of the compiled terminal description:
