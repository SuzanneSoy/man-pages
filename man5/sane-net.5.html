sane-net - SANE network backend
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>sane-net</B>

library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that
provides access to image acquisition devices through a network
connection.  This makes it possible to control devices attached to a
remote host and also provides a means to grant users access to
protected resources.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DEVICE NAMES</H2>

This backend expects device names of the form:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
<I>host</I>:<I>device</I>

</DL>

<P>

Where
<I>host</I>

is the name (or IP address) of the (remote) host and
<I>device</I>

is the name of the device on this host that should be addressed.
If the device name does not contain a colon (:), then the entire string
is treated as the
<I>device</I>

string for the default host.  The default host is the host listed last
in the configuration file (see below).
<P>

An IPv6 address can be specified enclosed in square brackets:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
<I>[::1]</I>:<I>device</I>

</DL>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

The
<I>net.conf</I>

file contains both backend options and a list of host names (or IP
addresses) that should be contacted for scan requests. Anything that
isn't one of the options listed below will be treated as an host name.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3"><B>connect_timeout = nsecs</B>

<DD>
Timeout (in seconds) for the initial connection to the
<I>saned</I>

server. This will prevent the backend from blocking for several
minutes trying to connect to an unresponsive
<I>saned</I>

host (network outage, host down, ...). The environment variable
<B>SANE_NET_TIMEOUT</B>

can also be used to specify the timeout at runtime.
</DL>
<P>

Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are
ignored.  Note that IPv6 addresses in this file do not need to be enclosed
in square brackets.  A sample configuration file is shown below:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="4"><DD>
scan-server.somedomain.firm
<BR>

192.168.0.1
<BR>

# this is a comment
<BR>

localhost
<BR>

::1
</DL>

<P>

The above list of hosts can be extended at run-time using environment
variable
<B>SANE_NET_HOSTS</B>.

This environment variable is a colon-separated list of hostnames or IP
addresses that should be contacted in addition to the hosts mentioned in
the configuration file.  For example, a user could set the environment
variable to the string:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="5"><DD>
new.scanner.com:[::1]:192.168.0.2:scanner.univ.edu
</DL>

<P>

To request that hosts
<I>new.scanner.com</I>

,
<I>[::1]</I>

,
<I>192.168.0.2</I>

and
<I>scanner.univ.edu</I>

are contacted in addition to the hosts listed above.
<P>

For this backend to function properly, it is also necessary to define the
<B>sane-port</B>

service in
<I>/etc/services</I>.

The
<B>sane</B>

service should be defined using a line of the following form:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="6"><DD>
sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon
</DL>

<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="7"><I>@CONFIGDIR@/net.conf</I>

<DD>
The backend configuration file (see also description of
<B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

below).
<DT id="8"><I>@LIBDIR@/libsane-net.a</I>

<DD>
The static library implementing this backend.
<DT id="9"><I>@LIBDIR@/libsane-net.so</I>

<DD>
The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="10"><B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

<DD>
This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file
is searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in @CONFIGDIR@.  If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories.  For example, setting
<B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;@CONFIGDIR@&quot; being searched (in this order).
<DT id="11"><B>SANE_NET_HOSTS</B>

<DD>
A colon-separated list of host names or IP addresses to be contacted by this
backend.
<DT id="12"><B>SANE_NET_TIMEOUT</B>

<DD>
Number of seconds to wait for a response from the
<I>saned</I>

server for the initial connection request.
<DT id="13"><B>SANE_DEBUG_NET</B>

<DD>
If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
levels reduce verbosity.
</DL>

<H2>BUGS</H2>

If saned has timed out, the net backend may loop with authorization requests.
