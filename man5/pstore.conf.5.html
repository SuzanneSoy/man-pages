pstore.conf, pstore.conf.d - PStore configuration file

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

/etc/systemd/pstore.conf

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This file configures the behavior of
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+systemd-pstore">systemd-pstore</A></B>(8), a tool for archiving the contents of the persistent storage filesystem,
m[blue]<B>pstore</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE</H2>

<P>

The default configuration is defined during compilation, so a configuration file is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. By default, the configuration file in
/etc/systemd/
contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. This file can be edited to create local overrides.
<P>

When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install configuration snippets in
/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/
or
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/. The main configuration file is read before any of the configuration directories, and has the lowest precedence; entries in a file in any configuration directory override entries in the single configuration file. Files in the
*.conf.d/
configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name takes precedence. For options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in files sorted lexicographically.
<P>

Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files.
<P>

To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

All options are configured in the
&quot;[PStore]&quot;
section:
<P>

<I>Storage=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
Controls where to archive (i.e. copy) files from the pstore filesystem. One of
&quot;none&quot;,
&quot;external&quot;, and
&quot;journal&quot;. When
&quot;none&quot;, the tool exits without processing files in the pstore filesystem. When
&quot;external&quot;
(the default), files are archived into
/var/lib/systemd/pstore/, and logged into the journal. When
&quot;journal&quot;, pstore file contents are logged only in the journal.
</DL>

<P>

<I>Unlink=</I>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
Controls whether or not files are removed from pstore after processing. Takes a boolean value. When true, a pstore file is removed from the pstore once it has been archived (either to disk or into the journal). When false, processing of pstore files occurs normally, but the files remain in the pstore. The default is true in order to maintain the pstore in a nearly empty state, so that the pstore has storage available for the next kernel error event.
</DL>

<P>

The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the template
/etc/systemd/pstore.conf
file that is installed by default.
