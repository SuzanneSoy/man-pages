sane-dll - SANE dynamic backend loader
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>sane-dll</B>

library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that
provides access to an arbitrary number of other SANE backends.  These
backends may either be pre-loaded at the time the
<B>sane-dll</B>

library is built or, on systems that support dynamic loading of shared
libraries, the backends may be loaded at runtime.  In the latter case,
adding support for a new backend simply involves installing the
relevant library in
<I>@LIBDIR@</I>

and adding an entry to the
<I>dll.conf</I>

configuration file.  In other words, no applications need to be
modified or recompiled to add support for new devices.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DEVICE NAMES</H2>

This backend expects device names of the form:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
<I>backend</I>:<I>device</I>

</DL>

<P>

Where
<I>backend</I>

is the name of the backend and
<I>device</I>

is the name of the device in this backend that should be addressed.
If the device name does not contain a colon (:), then the entire string
is treated as the
<I>device</I>

string for the default backend.  The default backend is the backend
listed last in the configuration file (see below) or the first
pre-loaded backend (if any).
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

The contents of the
<I>dll.conf</I>

file is a list of backend names that may be loaded dynamically upon demand.
Empty lines are ignored, also everything after a hash mark (#). A sample
configuration file is shown below:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
net
<BR>

# this is a comment
<BR>

pnm
<BR>

mustek
</DL>

<P>

It is also possible to add a file in
<I>@CONFIGDIR@/dll.d</I>

that contains the list of backends to be added. Backends mentioned in a
file included in this directory will be added before any backends listed
in
<I>dll.conf.</I>

Files in
<I>@CONFIGDIR@/dll.d</I>

can be freely named. They shall follow the format conventions as apply for
<I>dll.conf.</I>

<P>
<P>

Note that backends that were pre-loaded when building this library do
not have to be listed in this configuration file.  That is, if a
backend was preloaded, then that backend will always be present,
regardless of whether it's listed in the configuration file or not.
<P>

The list of preloaded backends is determined by macro
<B>PRELOADABLE_BACKENDS</B>

in file backend/Makefile.in of the SANE source code distribution.  After
changing the value of this macro, it is necessary to reconfigure, rebuild,
and reinstall SANE for the change to take effect.
<P>
Aliases are defined in the config file
<I>dll.aliases</I>.

It can contain entries of the form
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="3"><DD>
<BR>

alias SomeName SaneDeviceName
<BR>

alias &quot;Some Name&quot; SaneDeviceName
<BR>

hide SaneDeviceName
</DL>

<P>

For example:
<P>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="4"><DD>
<BR>

alias Epson net:somehost:epson:/dev/sgX
<BR>

alias &quot;Siemens ST400&quot; st400:/dev/sgY
<BR>

hide net:somehost:pnm:0
<BR>

hide net:somehost:pnm:1
<BR>

alias &quot;Read from file&quot; pnm:0
<BR>

hide pnm:1
</DL>

<P>

<P>
Aliased device names are automatically hidden.
<P>
The idea is that users don't have to deal with complicated device
names (especially for networked devices), and to hide other exported
devices which might confuse them. Note that a hidden device can still
be accessed if the device name is known, it just doesn't appear on the
list.

<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="5"><I>@CONFIGDIR@/dll.aliases</I>

<DD>
The list of aliased or hidden backends.
<DT id="6"><I>@CONFIGDIR@/dll.conf</I>

<DD>
The backend configuration file (see also description of
<B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

below).
<DT id="7"><I>@LIBDIR@/libsane-dll.a</I>

<DD>
The static library implementing this backend.
<DT id="8"><I>@LIBDIR@/libsane-dll.so</I>

<DD>
The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that
support dynamic loading).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="9"><B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

<DD>
This environment variable specifies the list of directories that may
contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories are
separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are separated by a
semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file
is searched in two default directories: first, the current working
directory (&quot;.&quot;) and then in @CONFIGDIR@.  If the value of the
environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then
the default directories are searched after the explicitly specified
directories.  For example, setting
<B>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</B>

to &quot;/tmp/config:&quot; would result in directories &quot;tmp/config&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, and
&quot;@CONFIGDIR@&quot; being searched (in this order).
<DT id="10"><B>SANE_DEBUG_DLL</B>

<DD>
If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this
environment variable controls the debug level for this backend.  E.g.,
a value of 128 requests all debug output to be printed.  Smaller
levels reduce verbosity.
<P>

2      print normal messages
3      print debugging messages
4      print everything
