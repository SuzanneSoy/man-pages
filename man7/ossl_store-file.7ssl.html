ossl_store-file - The store 'file' scheme loader
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



Support for the 'file' scheme is built into <TT>&quot;libcrypto&quot;</TT>.
Since files come in all kinds of formats and content types, the 'file'
scheme has its own layer of functionality called ``file handlers'',
which are used to try to decode diverse types of file contents.
<P>

In case a file is formatted as <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM,</FONT> each called file handler receives
the <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT> name (everything following any '<TT>&quot;-----BEGIN &quot;</TT>') as well as
possible <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT> headers, together with the decoded <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT> body.  Since <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT>
formatted files can contain more than one object, the file handlers
are called upon for each such object.
<P>

If the file isn't determined to be formatted as <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM,</FONT> the content is
loaded in raw form in its entirety and passed to the available file
handlers as is, with no <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT> name or headers.
<P>

Each file handler is expected to handle <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT> and non-PEM content as
appropriate.  Some may refuse non-PEM content for the sake of
determinism (for example, there are keys out in the wild that are
represented as an <FONT SIZE="-1">ASN.1 OCTET STRING.</FONT>  In raw form, it's not easily
possible to distinguish those from any other data coming as an <FONT SIZE="-1">ASN.1
OCTET STRING,</FONT> so such keys would naturally be accepted as <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT> files
only).

<H2>NOTES</H2>



When needed, the 'file' scheme loader will require a pass phrase by
using the <TT>&quot;UI_METHOD&quot;</TT> that was passed via <B>OSSL_STORE_open()</B>.
This pass phrase is expected to be <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> encoded, anything else will
give an undefined result.
The files made accessible through this loader are expected to be
standard compliant with regards to pass phrase encoding.
Files that aren't should be re-generated with a correctly encoded pass
phrase.
