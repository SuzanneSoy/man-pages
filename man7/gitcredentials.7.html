gitcredentials - providing usernames and passwords to Git
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

git config credential.<A HREF="https://example.com.username">https://example.com.username</A> myusername

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Git will sometimes need credentials from the user in order to perform operations; for example, it may need to ask for a username and password in order to access a remote repository over HTTP. This manual describes the mechanisms Git uses to request these credentials, as well as some features to avoid inputting these credentials repeatedly.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REQUESTING CREDENTIALS</H2>

<P>
Without any credential helpers defined, Git will try the following strategies to ask the user for usernames and passwords:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
 1.


If the
<B>GIT_ASKPASS</B>
environment variable is set, the program specified by the variable is invoked. A suitable prompt is provided to the program on the command line, and the user's input is read from its standard output.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
 2.


Otherwise, if the
<B>core.askPass</B>
configuration variable is set, its value is used as above.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3"><DD>
 3.


Otherwise, if the
<B>SSH_ASKPASS</B>
environment variable is set, its value is used as above.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="4"><DD>
 4.


Otherwise, the user is prompted on the terminal.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AVOIDING REPETITION</H2>

<P>
It can be cumbersome to input the same credentials over and over. Git provides two methods to reduce this annoyance:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="5"><DD>
 1.


Static configuration of usernames for a given authentication context.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="6"><DD>
 2.


Credential helpers to cache or store passwords, or to interact with a system password wallet or keychain.
</DL>

<P>
The first is simple and appropriate if you do not have secure storage available for a password. It is generally configured by adding this to your config:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="7"><DD>



<PRE>
[credential &quot;<A HREF="https://example.com">https://example.com</A>&quot;]
        username = me
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
Credential helpers, on the other hand, are external programs from which Git can request both usernames and passwords; they typically interface with secure storage provided by the OS or other programs.
<P>
To use a helper, you must first select one to use. Git currently includes the following helpers:
<P>

cache
<DL COMPACT><DT id="8"><DD>
Cache credentials in memory for a short period of time. See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git-credential-cache">git-credential-cache</A></B>(1)
for details.
</DL>

<P>

store
<DL COMPACT><DT id="9"><DD>
Store credentials indefinitely on disk. See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git-credential-store">git-credential-store</A></B>(1)
for details.
</DL>

<P>
You may also have third-party helpers installed; search for <B>credential-*</B> in the output of <B>git help -a</B>, and consult the documentation of individual helpers. Once you have selected a helper, you can tell Git to use it by putting its name into the credential.helper variable.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="10"><DD>
 1.


Find a helper.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="11"><DD>



<PRE>
$ git help -a | grep credential-
credential-foo
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="12"><DD>
 2.


Read its description.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="13"><DD>



<PRE>
$ git help credential-foo
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="14"><DD>
 3.


Tell Git to use it.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="15"><DD>



<PRE>
$ git config --global credential.helper foo
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
</DL>

<H2>CREDENTIAL CONTEXTS</H2>

<P>
Git considers each credential to have a context defined by a URL. This context is used to look up context-specific configuration, and is passed to any helpers, which may use it as an index into secure storage.
<P>
For instance, imagine we are accessing <B><A HREF="https://example.com/foo.git">https://example.com/foo.git</A></B>. When Git looks into a config file to see if a section matches this context, it will consider the two a match if the context is a more-specific subset of the pattern in the config file. For example, if you have this in your config file:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="16"><DD>



<PRE>
[credential &quot;<A HREF="https://example.com">https://example.com</A>&quot;]
        username = foo
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
then we will match: both protocols are the same, both hosts are the same, and the &quot;pattern&quot; URL does not care about the path component at all. However, this context would not match:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="17"><DD>



<PRE>
[credential &quot;<A HREF="https://kernel.org">https://kernel.org</A>&quot;]
        username = foo
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
because the hostnames differ. Nor would it match <B>foo.example.com</B>; Git compares hostnames exactly, without considering whether two hosts are part of the same domain. Likewise, a config entry for <B><A HREF="http://example.com">http://example.com</A></B> would not match: Git compares the protocols exactly.
<P>
If the &quot;pattern&quot; URL does include a path component, then this too must match exactly: the context <B><A HREF="https://example.com/bar/baz.git">https://example.com/bar/baz.git</A></B> will match a config entry for <B><A HREF="https://example.com/bar/baz.git">https://example.com/bar/baz.git</A></B> (in addition to matching the config entry for <B><A HREF="https://example.com">https://example.com</A></B>) but will not match a config entry for <B><A HREF="https://example.com/bar">https://example.com/bar</A></B>.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
Options for a credential context can be configured either in <B>credential.*</B> (which applies to all credentials), or <B>credential.&lt;url&gt;.*</B>, where &lt;url&gt; matches the context as described above.
<P>
The following options are available in either location:
<P>

helper
<DL COMPACT><DT id="18"><DD>
The name of an external credential helper, and any associated options. If the helper name is not an absolute path, then the string
<B>git credential-</B>
is prepended. The resulting string is executed by the shell (so, for example, setting this to
<B>foo --option=bar</B>
will execute
<B>git credential-foo --option=bar</B>
via the shell. See the manual of specific helpers for examples of their use.
<P>
If there are multiple instances of the
<B>credential.helper</B>
configuration variable, each helper will be tried in turn, and may provide a username, password, or nothing. Once Git has acquired both a username and a password, no more helpers will be tried.
<P>
If
<B>credential.helper</B>
is configured to the empty string, this resets the helper list to empty (so you may override a helper set by a lower-priority config file by configuring the empty-string helper, followed by whatever set of helpers you would like).
</DL>

<P>

username
<DL COMPACT><DT id="19"><DD>
A default username, if one is not provided in the URL.
</DL>

<P>

useHttpPath
<DL COMPACT><DT id="20"><DD>
By default, Git does not consider the &quot;path&quot; component of an http URL to be worth matching via external helpers. This means that a credential stored for
<B><A HREF="https://example.com/foo.git">https://example.com/foo.git</A></B>
will also be used for
<B><A HREF="https://example.com/bar.git">https://example.com/bar.git</A></B>. If you do want to distinguish these cases, set this option to
<B>true</B>.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CUSTOM HELPERS</H2>

<P>
You can write your own custom helpers to interface with any system in which you keep credentials. See credential.h for details.
