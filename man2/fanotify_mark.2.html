<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

For an overview of the fanotify API, see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+fanotify">fanotify</A></B>(7).

<P>

<B>fanotify_mark</B>()

adds, removes, or modifies an fanotify mark on a filesystem object.
The caller must have read permission on the filesystem object that
is to be marked.
<P>

The
<I>fanotify_fd</I>

argument is a file descriptor returned by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+fanotify_init">fanotify_init</A></B>(2).

<P>

<I>flags</I>

is a bit mask describing the modification to perform.
It must include exactly one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>FAN_MARK_ADD</B>

<DD>
The events in
<I>mask</I>

will be added to the mark mask (or to the ignore mask).
<I>mask</I>

must be nonempty or the error
<B>EINVAL</B>

will occur.
<DT id="2"><B>FAN_MARK_REMOVE</B>

<DD>
The events in argument
<I>mask</I>

will be removed from the mark mask (or from the ignore mask).
<I>mask</I>

must be nonempty or the error
<B>EINVAL</B>

will occur.
<DT id="3"><B>FAN_MARK_FLUSH</B>

<DD>
Remove either all marks for filesystems, all marks for mounts, or all
marks for directories and files from the fanotify group.
If
<I>flags</I>

contains
<B>FAN_MARK_MOUNT</B>,

all marks for mounts are removed from the group.
If
<I>flags</I>

contains
<B>FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM</B>,

all marks for filesystems are removed from the group.
Otherwise, all marks for directories and files are removed.
No flag other than and at most one of the flags
<B>FAN_MARK_MOUNT</B>

or
<B>FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM</B>

can be used in conjunction with
<B>FAN_MARK_FLUSH</B>.

<I>mask</I>

is ignored.
</DL>
<P>

If none of the values above is specified, or more than one is specified,
the call fails with the error
<B>EINVAL</B>.

<P>

In addition,
zero or more of the following values may be ORed into
<I>flags</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4"><B>FAN_MARK_DONT_FOLLOW</B>

<DD>
If
<I>pathname</I>

is a symbolic link, mark the link itself, rather than the file to which it
refers.
(By default,
<B>fanotify_mark</B>()

dereferences
<I>pathname</I>

if it is a symbolic link.)
<DT id="5"><B>FAN_MARK_ONLYDIR</B>

<DD>
If the filesystem object to be marked is not a directory, the error
<B>ENOTDIR</B>

shall be raised.
<DT id="6"><B>FAN_MARK_MOUNT</B>

<DD>
Mark the mount point specified by
<I>pathname</I>.

If
<I>pathname</I>

is not itself a mount point, the mount point containing
<I>pathname</I>

will be marked.
All directories, subdirectories, and the contained files of the mount point
will be monitored.
This value cannot be used if the
<I>fanotify_fd</I>

file descriptor has been initialized with the flag
<B>FAN_REPORT_FID</B>

or if any of the new directory modification events are provided as a
<I>mask</I>.

Attempting to do so will result in the error
<B>EINVAL</B>

being returned.
<DT id="7"><B>FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM</B> (since Linux 4.20)

<DD>

Mark the filesystem specified by
<I>pathname</I>.

The filesystem containing
<I>pathname</I>

will be marked.
All the contained files and directories of the filesystem from any mount
point will be monitored.
<DT id="8"><B>FAN_MARK_IGNORED_MASK</B>

<DD>
The events in
<I>mask</I>

shall be added to or removed from the ignore mask.
<DT id="9"><B>FAN_MARK_IGNORED_SURV_MODIFY</B>

<DD>
The ignore mask shall survive modify events.
If this flag is not set,
the ignore mask is cleared when a modify event occurs
for the ignored file or directory.
</DL>
<P>

<I>mask</I>

defines which events shall be listened for (or which shall be ignored).
It is a bit mask composed of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="10"><B>FAN_ACCESS</B>

<DD>
Create an event when a file or directory (but see BUGS) is accessed (read).
<DT id="11"><B>FAN_MODIFY</B>

See NOTES for additional details.
<DT id="16"><B>FAN_ATTRIB</B> (since Linux 5.1)

<DD>

Create an event when the metadata for a file or directory has changed.
<DT id="17"><B>FAN_CREATE</B> (since Linux 5.1)

<DD>

Create an event when a file or directory has been created in a marked
parent directory.
<DT id="18"><B>FAN_DELETE</B> (since Linux 5.1)

<DD>

Create an event when a file or directory has been deleted in a marked
parent directory.
<DT id="19"><B>FAN_DELETE_SELF</B> (since Linux 5.1)

<DD>

Create an event when a marked file or directory itself is deleted.
<DT id="20"><B>FAN_MOVED_FROM</B> (since Linux 5.1)

<DD>

Create an event when a file or directory has been moved from a marked
parent directory.
<DT id="21"><B>FAN_MOVED_TO</B> (since Linux 5.1)

<DD>

Create an event when a file or directory has been moved to a marked parent
directory.
<DT id="22"><B>FAN_MOVE_SELF</B> (since Linux 5.1)

<DD>

<DT id="23"><B>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW</B>

<DD>
Create an event when an overflow of the event queue occurs.
The size of the event queue is limited to 16384 entries if
<B>FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE</B>

is not set in
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+fanotify_init">fanotify_init</A></B>(2).

<DT id="24"><B>FAN_OPEN_PERM</B>

<DD>
Create an event when a permission to open a file or directory is requested.
An fanotify file descriptor created with
<B>FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT</B>

or
<B>FAN_CLASS_CONTENT</B>

is required.
<DT id="25"><B>FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM</B> (since Linux 5.0)

<DD>

Create an event when a permission to open a file for execution is
requested.
An fanotify file descriptor created with
<B>FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT</B>

or
<B>FAN_CLASS_CONTENT</B>

is required.
See NOTES for additional details.
<DT id="26"><B>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</B>

<DD>
Create an event when a permission to read a file or directory is requested.
An fanotify file descriptor created with
<B>FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT</B>

or
<B>FAN_CLASS_CONTENT</B>

is required.
<DT id="27"><B>FAN_ONDIR</B>

<DD>
Create events for directories---for example, when
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+opendir">opendir</A></B>(3),

<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+readdir">readdir</A></B>(3)

(but see BUGS), and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+closedir">closedir</A></B>(3)

are called.
Without this flag, only events for files are created.
The
<B>FAN_ONDIR</B>

flag is reported in an event mask only if the
<I>fanotify_fd</I>

file descriptor has been initialized with the flag
<B>FAN_REPORT_FID</B>.

In the context of directory entry events, such as
<B>FAN_CREATE</B>,

<B>FAN_DELETE</B>,

<B>FAN_MOVED_FROM</B>,

and
<B>FAN_MOVED_TO</B>

for example, specifying the flag
<B>FAN_ONDIR</B>

is required in order to create events when subdirectory entries are
modified (i.e.,
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+mkdir">mkdir</A></B>(2)/

<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+rmdir">rmdir</A></B>(2)).

Subdirectory entry modification events will never be merged with
nonsubdirectory entry modification events.
This flag is never reported individually within an event and is always
supplied in conjunction with another event type.
<DT id="28"><B>FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD</B>

<DD>
Events for the immediate children of marked directories shall be created.
The flag has no effect when marking mounts and filesystems.
Note that events are not generated for children of the subdirectories
of marked directories.
To monitor complete directory trees it is necessary to mark the relevant
mount.
</DL>
<P>

The following composed values are defined:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="29"><B>FAN_CLOSE</B>

<DD>
A file is closed
(<B>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</B>|<B>FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</B>).

<DT id="30"><B>FAN_MOVE</B>

<DD>
A file or directory has been moved
(<B>FAN_MOVED_FROM</B>|<B>FAN_MOVED_TO</B>).

</DL>
<P>

The filesystem object to be marked is determined by the file descriptor
<I>dirfd</I>

and the pathname specified in
<I>pathname</I>:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="31">*<DD>
If
<I>pathname</I>

is NULL,
<I>dirfd</I>

defines the filesystem object to be marked.
<DT id="32">*<DD>
If
<I>pathname</I>

is NULL, and
<I>dirfd</I>

takes the special value
<B>AT_FDCWD</B>,

the current working directory is to be marked.
<DT id="33">*<DD>
If
<I>pathname</I>

is absolute, it defines the filesystem object to be marked, and
<I>dirfd</I>

is ignored.
<DT id="34">*<DD>
If
<I>pathname</I>

is relative, and
<I>dirfd</I>

does not have the value
<B>AT_FDCWD</B>,

then the filesystem object to be marked is determined by interpreting
<I>pathname</I>

relative the directory referred to by
<I>dirfd</I>.

<DT id="35">*<DD>
If
<I>pathname</I>

is relative, and
<I>dirfd</I>

has the value
<B>AT_FDCWD</B>,

then the filesystem object to be marked is determined by interpreting
<I>pathname</I>

relative the current working directory.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success,
<B>fanotify_mark</B>()

returns 0.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="36"><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
An invalid file descriptor was passed in
<I>fanotify_fd</I>.

<DT id="37"><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
An invalid value was passed in
<I>flags</I>

or
<I>mask</I>,

or
<I>fanotify_fd</I>

was not an fanotify file descriptor.
<DT id="38"><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The fanotify file descriptor was opened with
<B>FAN_CLASS_NOTIF</B>

or
<B>FAN_REPORT_FID</B>

and mask contains a flag for permission events
(<B>FAN_OPEN_PERM</B>

or
<B>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</B>).

<DT id="39"><B>ENODEV</B>

<DD>
The filesystem object indicated by
<I>pathname</I>

is not associated with a filesystem that supports
<I>fsid</I>

(e.g.,
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+tmpfs">tmpfs</A></B>(5)).

This error can be returned only when an fanotify file descriptor returned
by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+fanotify_init">fanotify_init</A></B>(2)

has been created with
<B>FAN_REPORT_FID</B>.

<DT id="40"><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
The filesystem object indicated by
<I>dirfd</I>

and
<I>pathname</I>

does not exist.
This error also occurs when trying to remove a mark from an object
which is not marked.
<DT id="41"><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
The necessary memory could not be allocated.
<DT id="42"><B>ENOSPC</B>

<DD>
The number of marks exceeds the limit of 8192 and the

flag was not specified when the fanotify file descriptor was created with
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+fanotify_init">fanotify_init</A></B>(2).

<DT id="43"><B>ENOSYS</B>

<DD>
This kernel does not implement
<B>fanotify_mark</B>().

The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was configured with
<B>CONFIG_FANOTIFY</B>.

<DT id="44"><B>ENOTDIR</B>

<DD>
<I>flags</I>

contains
<B>FAN_MARK_ONLYDIR</B>,

and
<I>dirfd</I>

and
<I>pathname</I>

do not specify a directory.
<DT id="45"><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The object indicated by
<I>pathname</I>

is associated with a filesystem that does not support the encoding of file
handles.
This error can be returned only when an fanotify file descriptor returned
by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+fanotify_init">fanotify_init</A></B>(2)

has been created with
<B>FAN_REPORT_FID</B>.

<DT id="46"><B>EXDEV</B>

<DD>
The filesystem object indicated by
<I>pathname</I>

resides within a filesystem subvolume (e.g.,
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+btrfs">btrfs</A></B>(5))

which uses a different
<I>fsid</I>

than its root superblock.
This error can be returned only when an fanotify file descriptor returned
by
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+fanotify_init">fanotify_init</A></B>(2)

has been created with
<B>FAN_REPORT_FID</B>.

<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

<B>fanotify_mark</B>()

was introduced in version 2.6.36 of the Linux kernel and enabled in version
2.6.37.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This system call is Linux-specific.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>FAN_OPEN_EXEC and FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM</H3>

When using either
<B>FAN_OPEN_EXEC</B>

or
<B>FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM</B>

within the
<I>mask</I>,

events of these types will be returned only when the direct execution of a
program occurs.
More specifically, this means that events of these types will be generated
for files that are opened using
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+execve">execve</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+execveat">execveat</A></B>(2),

or
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+uselib">uselib</A></B>(2).

Events of these types will not be raised in the situation where an
interpreter is passed (or reads) a script file for interpretation.
<P>

Additionally, if a mark has also been placed on the Linux dynamic
linker, a user should also expect to receive an event for it when
an ELF object has been successfully opened using
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+execve">execve</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+execveat">execveat</A></B>(2).

<P>

For example, if the following ELF binary were to be invoked and a
<B>FAN_OPEN_EXEC</B>

mark has been placed on /:
<P>



$ /bin/echo foo


<P>

The listening application in this case would receive
<B>FAN_OPEN_EXEC</B>

events for both the ELF binary and interpreter, respectively:
<P>



/bin/echo
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

<B>FAN_MARK_FLUSH</B>,

<I>dirfd</I>

and
<I>pathname</I>

must specify a valid filesystem object, even though this object is not used.
<DT id="48">*<DD>

<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+readdir">readdir</A></B>(2)

does not generate a
<B>FAN_ACCESS</B>

event.
