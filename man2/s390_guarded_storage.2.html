<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>s390_guarded_storage</B>()

system call enables the use of the Guarded Storage Facility
(a z/Architecture-specific feature) for user-space processes.
<P>





The guarded storage facility is a hardware feature that allows marking up to
64 memory regions (as of z14) as guarded;
reading a pointer with a newly introduced &quot;Load Guarded&quot; (LGG)
or &quot;Load Logical and Shift Guarded&quot; (LLGFSG) instructions will cause
a range check on the loaded value and invoke a (previously set up)
user-space handler if one of the guarded regions is affected.
<P>

The

<I>command</I>

argument indicates which function to perform.
The following commands are supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>GS_ENABLE</B>

<DD>
Enable the guarded storage facility for the calling task.
The initial content of the guarded storage control block will be all zeros.
After enablement, user-space code can use the &quot;Load Guarded Storage
Controls&quot; (LGSC) instruction (or the
<B>load_gs_cb</B>()

function wrapper provided in the
<I>asm/guarded_storage.h</I>

header) to load an arbitrary control block.
While a task is enabled, the kernel will save and restore the calling content
of the guarded storage registers on context switch.
<DT id="2"><B>GS_DISABLE</B>

<DD>
Disables the use of the guarded storage facility for the calling task.
The kernel will cease to save and restore the content of the guarded storage
registers, the task-specific content of these registers is lost.
<DT id="3"><B>GS_SET_BC_CB</B>

<DD>
Set a broadcast guarded storage control block to the one provided in the
<I>gs_cb</I>

argument.
This is called per thread and associates a specific guarded storage control
block with the calling task.
This control block will be used in the broadcast command
<B>GS_BROADCAST</B>.

<DT id="4"><B>GS_CLEAR_BC_CB</B>

<DD>
Clears the broadcast guarded storage control block.
The guarded storage control block will no longer have the association
established by the
<B>GS_SET_BC_CB</B>

command.
<DT id="5"><B>GS_BROADCAST</B>

<DD>
Sends a broadcast to all thread siblings of the calling task.
Every sibling that has established a broadcast guarded storage control block
will load this control block and will be enabled for guarded storage.
The broadcast guarded storage control block is consumed; a second broadcast
without a refresh of the stored control block with
<B>GS_SET_BC_CB</B>

will not have any effect.
</DL>
<P>

The
<I>gs_cb</I>

argument specifies the address of a guarded storage control block structure
and is currently used only by the
<B>GS_SET_BC_CB</B>

command; all other aforementioned commands ignore this argument.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success, the return value of
<B>s390_guarded_storage</B>()

is 0.
<P>

On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set appropriately.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="6"><B>EFAULT</B>

<DD>
<I>command</I>

was
<B>GS_SET_BC_CB</B>

and the copying of the guarded storage control block structure pointed by the
<I>gs_cb</I>

argument has failed.
<DT id="7"><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The value provided in the
<I>command</I>

argument was not valid.
<DT id="8"><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
<I>command</I>

was one of
<B>GS_ENABLE</B> or <B>GS_SET_BC_CB</B>,

and the allocation of a new guarded storage control block has failed.
<DT id="9"><B>EOPNOTSUPP</B>

<DD>
The guarded storage facility is not supported by the hardware.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>


This system call is available since Linux 4.12.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This Linux-specific system call is available only on the s390 architecture.
<P>

The guarded storage facility is available beginning with System z14.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call, use
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+syscall">syscall</A></B>(2)

to call it.
<P>

The description of the guarded storage facility along with related
instructions and Guarded Storage Control Block and
Guarded Storage Event Parameter List structure layouts
is available in &quot;z/Architecture Principles of Operations&quot;
beginning from the twelfth edition.
<P>

The
<I>gs_cb</I>

structure has a field
<I>gsepla</I>

(Guarded Storage Event Parameter List Address), which is a user-space pointer
to a Guarded Storage Event Parameter List structure
(that contains the address
of the aforementioned event handler in the
<I>gseha</I>

field), and its layout is available as a
<B>gs_epl</B>

structure type definition in the
<I>asm/guarded_storage.h</I>

header.
