<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The ETF (Earliest TxTime First) qdisc allows applications to control
the instant when a packet should be dequeued from the traffic control
layer into the netdevice. If
<B>offload</B>

is configured and supported by the network interface card, the it will
also control when packets leave the network controller.
<P>
ETF achieves that by buffering packets until a configurable time
before their transmission time (i.e. txtime, or deadline), which can
be configured through the
<B>delta</B>

option.
<P>
The qdisc uses a rb-tree internally so packets are always 'ordered' by
their txtime and will be dequeued following the (next) earliest txtime
first.
<P>
It relies on the SO_TXTIME socket option and the SCM_TXTIME CMSG in
each packet field to configure the behavior of time dependent sockets:
the clockid to be used as a reference, if the expected mode of txtime
for that socket is deadline or strict mode, and if packet drops should
be reported on the socket's error queue. See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+socket">socket</A>(7)</B>

for more information.
<P>
The etf qdisc will drop any packets with a txtime in the past, or if a
packet expires while waiting for being dequeued.
<P>
This queueing discipline is intended to be used by TSN (Time Sensitive
Networking) applications, and it exposes a traffic shaping functionality
that is commonly documented as &quot;Launch Time&quot; or &quot;Time-Based Scheduling&quot;
by vendors and the documentation of network interface controllers.
<P>
ETF is meant to be installed under another qdisc that maps packet flows
to traffic classes, one example is
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+mqprio">mqprio</A>(8).</B>

<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">clockid<DD>
<BR>

Specifies the clock to be used by qdisc's internal timer for measuring
time and scheduling events. The qdisc expects that packets passing
through it to be using this same
<B>clockid</B>

as the reference of their txtime timestamps. It will drop packets
coming from sockets that do not comply with that.
<P>
For more information about time and clocks on Linux, please refer
to
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+time">time</A>(7)</B>

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+clock_gettime">clock_gettime</A>(3).</B>

<P>
<DT id="2">delta<DD>
<BR>

After enqueueing or dequeueing a packet, the qdisc will schedule its
next wake-up time for the next txtime minus this delta value.
This means
<B>delta</B>

can be used as a fudge factor for the scheduler latency of a system.
This value must be specified in nanoseconds.
The default value is 0 nanoseconds.
<P>
<DT id="3">deadline_mode<DD>
<BR>

When
<B>deadline_mode</B>

is set, the qdisc will handle txtime with a different semantics,
changed from a 'strict' transmission time to a deadline.
In practice, this means during the dequeue flow
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+etf">etf</A>(8)</B>

will set the txtime of the packet being dequeued to 'now'.
The default is for this option to be disabled.
<P>
<DT id="4">offload<DD>
<BR>

When
<B>offload</B>

is set,
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+etf">etf</A>(8)</B>

will try to configure the network interface so time-based transmission
arbitration is enabled in the controller. This feature is commonly
referred to as &quot;Launch Time&quot; or &quot;Time-Based Scheduling&quot; by the
documentation of network interface controllers.
The default is for this option to be disabled.
<P>
<DT id="5">skip_sock_check<DD>
<BR>

<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+etf">etf</A>(8)</B>

currently drops any packet which does not have a socket associated with it or
if the socket does not have SO_TXTIME socket option set. But, this will not
work if the launchtime is set by another entity inside the kernel (e.g. some
other Qdisc). Setting the skip_sock_check will skip checking for a socket
associated with the packet.
<P>

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>
ETF is used to enforce a Quality of Service. It controls when each
packets should be dequeued and transmitted, and can be used for
limiting the data rate of a traffic class. To separate packets into
traffic classes the user may choose
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+mqprio">mqprio</A>(8),</B>

and configure it like this:
<P>

# tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle 100: parent root mqprio num_tc 3 \
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>map 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \<BR>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>queues 1@0 1@1 2@2 \<BR>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>hw 0<BR>

<P>

To replace the current queueing discipline by ETF in traffic class
number 0, issue:
<P>


# tc qdisc replace dev eth0 parent 100:1 etf \
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>clockid CLOCK_TAI delta 300000 offload<BR>

<P>
With the options above, etf will be configured to use CLOCK_TAI as
its clockid_t, will schedule packets for 300 us before their txtime,
and will enable the functionality on that in the network interface
card. Deadline mode will not be configured for this mode.
