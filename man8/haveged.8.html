<H2>NAME</H2>

haveged - Generate random numbers and feed Linux's random device.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>haveged [options]</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>haveged</B>

generates an unpredictable stream of random numbers harvested from the indirect
effects of hardware events on hidden processor state (caches, branch predictors,
memory translation tables, etc) using the HAVEGE (HArdware Volatile Entropy
Gathering and Expansion) algorithm. The algorithm operates in user space, no
special privilege is required for file system access to the output stream.
<P>

Linux pools randomness for distribution by the /dev/random and /dev/urandom
device interfaces. The standard mechanisms of filling the /dev/random pool may
not be sufficient to meet demand on systems with high needs or limited user
interaction. In those circumstances,
<B>haveged</B>

may be run as a privileged daemon to fill the /dev/random pool whenever the
supply of random bits in /dev/random falls below the low water mark of the
device.
<P>

<B>haveged</B>

tunes itself to its environment and provides the same built-in test suite
for the output stream as used on certified hardware security devices. See
<B>NOTES</B>

below for further information.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">-b nnn, --buffer=nnn<DD>
Set collection buffer size to nnn KW. Default is 128KW (or 512KB).
<DT id="2">-d nnn, --data=nnn<DD>
Set data cache size to nnn KB. Default is 16 or as determined dynamically.
<DT id="3">-f file, --file=file<DD>
Set output file path for non-daemon use. Default is &quot;sample&quot;,
use &quot;-&quot; for stdout.
<DT id="4">-F , --Foreground<DD>
Run daemon in foreground. Do not fork and detach.
<DT id="5">-i nnn, --inst=nnn<DD>
Set instruction cache size to nnn KB. Default is 16 or as determined dynamically.
<DT id="6">-n nnn, --number=nnn<DD>
Set number of bytes written to the output file. The value may be specified using one
of the suffixes k, m, g, or t. The upper bound of this value is &quot;16t&quot; (2^44 Bytes = 16TB).
A value of 0 indicates unbounded output and forces output to stdout. This argument is
required if the daemon interface is not present. If the daemon interface is present, this
setting takes precedence over any --run value.
<DT id="7">-o &lt;spec&gt;, --onlinetest=&lt;spec&gt;<DD>
Specify online tests to run. The &lt;spec&gt; consists of optional &quot;t&quot;ot and
&quot;c&quot;ontinuous groups, each group indicates the procedures to be run, using &quot;a&lt;n&gt;&quot;
to indicate a AIS-31 procedure A variant, and &quot;b&quot; to indicate AIS procedure B.
The specifications are order independent (procedure B always runs first in each
group) and case insensitive. The a&lt;n&gt; variations exist to mitigate the a slow
autocorrelation test (test5). Normally all procedure A tests, except the first
are iterated 257 times. An a&lt;n&gt; option indicates test5 should only be executed
every modulo &lt;n&gt; times during the procedure's 257 repetitions. The effect is so
noticeable that A8 is the usual choice.
<P>
The &quot;tot&quot; tests run only at initialization - there are no negative performance
consequences except for a slight increase in the time required to initialize.
The &quot;tot&quot; tests guarantee haveged has initialized properly. The use of both test
procedures in the &quot;tot&quot; test is highly recommended because the two test emphasize
different aspects of RNG quality.
<P>
In continuous testing, the test sequence is cycled repeatedly. For example, the
string &quot;tbca8b&quot; (suitable for an AIS NTG.1 device) would run procedure B for the
&quot;tot&quot; test, then cycle between procedure A8 and procedure B continuously for all
further output. Continuous testing does not come for free, impacting both
throughput and resource consumption. Continual testing also opens up the possibility
of a test failure. A strict retry procedure recovers from spurious failure in all but
the most extreme circumstances. When the retry fails, operation will terminate unless
a &quot;w&quot; has been appended to the test token to make the test advisory only. In our
example above, the string &quot;tbca8wbw&quot; would make all continuous tests advisory. For
more detailed information on AIS retries see
<B>NOTES</B>

below.
<P>
Complete control over the test configuration is provided for flexibility. The
defaults (ta8bcb&quot; if run as a daemon and &quot;ta8b&quot; otherwise) are suitable for most
circumstances.
<P>
<DT id="8">-p file, --pidfile=file<DD>
Set file path for the daemon pid file. Default is &quot;/var/run/haveged.pid&quot;,
<DT id="9">-r n, --run=n<DD>
Set run level for daemon interface:
<P>
n = 0 Run as daemon - must be root. Fills /dev/random when the supply of random bits
<BR>&nbsp;falls&nbsp;below&nbsp;the&nbsp;low&nbsp;water&nbsp;mark&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;device.&nbsp;
<P>
n = 1 Display configuration info and terminate.
<P>
n &gt; 1 Write &lt;n&gt; kb of output. Deprecated (use --number instead), only provided for backward
compatibility.
<P>
If --number is specified, values other than 0,1 are ignored. Default is 0. 
<DT id="10">-v n, --verbose=n<DD>
Set diagnostic bitmap as sum of following options:
<P>
1=Show build/tuning summary on termination, summary for online test retries.
<P>
2=Show online test retry details
<P>
4=Show timing for collections
<P>
8=Show collection loop layout
<P>
16=Show collection loop code offsets
<P>
32=Show all online test completion detail
<P>
Default is 0. Use -1 for all diagnostics.
<DT id="11">-w nnn, --write=nnn<DD>
Set write_wakeup_threshold of daemon interface to nnn bits. Applies only to run level 0.
<DT id="12">-?, --help<DD>
This summary of program options.
<P>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<P>

haveged tunes the HAVEGE algorithm for maximum effectiveness using a hierarchy
of defaults, command line options, virtual file system information, and cpuid
information where available. Under most circumstances, user input is not
required for excellent results.
<P>

Run-time testing provides assurance of correct haveged operation. The run-time
test suite is modeled upon the AIS-31 specification of the German Common
Criteria body, BIS. This specification is typically applied to hardware devices,
requiring formal certification and mandated start-up and continuous operational
testing. Because haveged runs on many different hardware platforms, certification
cannot be a goal, but the AIS-31 test suite provides the means to assess haveged
output with the same operational tests applied to certified hardware devices.
<P>

AIS test procedure A performs 6 tests to check for statistically inconspicuous
behavior. AIS test procedure B performs more theoretical tests such as checking
multi-step transition probabilities and making an empirical entropy estimate.
Procedure A is the much more resource and compute intensive of the two but is
still recommended for the haveged start-up tests. Procedure B is well suited to
use of haveged as a daemon because the test entropy estimate confirms the
entropy estimate haveged uses when adding entropy to the /dev/random device.
<P>

No test is perfect. There is a 10e-4 probability that a perfect generator will
fail either of the test procedures. AIS-31 mandates a strict retry policy to
filter out false alarms and haveged always logs test procedure failures. Retries
are expected but rarely observed except when large data sets are generated with
continuous testing. See the

notes for more detailed information.

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

Haveged returns 0 for success and non-zero for failure. The failure return code is 1
&quot;general failure&quot; unless execution is terminated by signal &lt;n&gt;, in which case
the return code will be 128 + &lt;n&gt;. The following diagnostics are issued to stderr
upon non-zero termination:
