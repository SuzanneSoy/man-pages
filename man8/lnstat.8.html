lnstat - unified linux network statistics
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>lnstat</B>

[<I>options</I>]

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This manual page documents briefly the
<B>lnstat</B>

command.
<P>

<B>lnstat</B> is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the old
rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodically print a selection of
statistical values exported by the kernel.
In addition to routing cache statistics, it supports any kind of statistics the
linux kernel exports via a file in /proc/net/stat/.
<P>

Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the column names.
These names are used by <B>lnstat</B> as keys for selecting which statistics to
print. For every CPU present in the system, a line follows which lists the
actual values for each column of the file. <B>lnstat</B> sums these values up
(which in fact are counters) before printing them. After each interval, only
the difference to the last value is printed.
<P>

Files and columns may be selected by using the <B>-f</B> and <B>-k</B>
parameters. By default, all columns of all files are printed.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

lnstat supports the following options.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>-h, --help</B>

<DD>
Show summary of options.
<DT id="2"><B>-V, --version</B>

<DD>
Show version of program.
<DT id="3"><B>-c, --count &lt;count&gt;</B>

<DD>
Print &lt;count&gt; number of intervals.
<DT id="4"><B>-d, --dump</B>

<DD>
Dump list of available files/keys.
<DT id="5"><B>-f, --file &lt;file&gt;</B>

<DD>
Statistics file to use, may be specified multiple times. By default all files in /proc/net/stat are scanned.
<DT id="6"><B>-i, --interval &lt;intv&gt;</B>

<DD>
Set interval to 'intv' seconds.
<DT id="7"><B>-j, --json</B>

<DD>
Display results in JSON format
<DT id="8"><B>-k, --keys k,k,k,...</B>

<DD>
Display only keys specified. Each key <B>k</B> is of the form <B>[file:]key</B>. If <B>&lt;file&gt;</B>
is given, the search for the given key is limited to that file. Otherwise the first file containing
the searched key is being used.
<DT id="9"><B>-s, --subject [0-2]</B>

<DD>
Specify display of subject/header. '0' means no header at all, '1' prints a header only at start of the program and '2' prints a header every 20 lines.
<DT id="10"><B>-w, --width n,n,n,...</B>

<DD>
Width for each field.
