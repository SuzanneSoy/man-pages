<H2>NAME</H2>

find - search for files in a directory hierarchy
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>find</B>

[-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This manual page
documents the GNU version of
<B>find</B>.

GNU
<B>find</B>

searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by
evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the
rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is
known (the left hand side is false for <I>and</I> operations, true for
<I>or</I>),

at which point
<B>find</B>

moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified,
`.' is assumed.
<P>

If you are using
<B>find</B>

in an environment where security is important (for example if you are
using it to search directories that are writable by other users), you
should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the findutils
documentation, which is called <B>Finding Files</B> and comes with
findutils.
That document also includes a lot more detail
and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful
source of information.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The
<B>-H</B>,

<B>-L</B>

and
<B>-P</B>

options control the treatment of symbolic
links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names
of files or directories to be examined, up to the first argument that
begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any
following arguments are taken to be the expression describing what is
to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is
used.  If no expression is given, the expression
<B>-print</B>

is used
(but you should probably consider using
<B>-print0</B>

instead, anyway).
<P>

This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.
These options control the behaviour of
<B>find</B>

but are specified immediately after the last path name.  The five
`real' options
<B>-H</B>,

<B>-L</B>,

<B>-P</B>,

<B>-D</B>

and
<B>-O</B>

must appear before
the first path name, if at all.  A double dash
<B>--</B>

can also be used
to signal that any remaining arguments are not options (though
ensuring that all start points begin with either `./' or `/' is
generally safer if you use wildcards in the list of start points).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">-P<DD>
Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When
<B>find</B>

examines or prints information a file, and the file is a symbolic
link, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the
symbolic link itself.
<P>
<DT id="2">-L<DD>
Follow symbolic links.  When
<B>find</B>

examines or prints information about files, the information used shall
be taken from the properties of the file to which the link points, not
from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or
<B>find</B>

is unable to examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this
option implies
<B>-noleaf</B>.

If you later use the
<B>-P</B>

option,
<B>-noleaf</B>

will still be in effect.  If
<B>-L</B>

is in effect and
<B>find</B>

discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search,
the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.
<DT id="3"><DD>
When the
<B>-L</B>

option is in effect, the
<B>-type</B>

predicate will always
match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to
rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).
Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while
<B>find</B>

is executing (for example
<B>-delete</B>)

can give rise to confusing behaviour.
Using
<B>-L</B>

causes the
<B>-lname</B>

and
<B>-ilname</B>

predicates always to return
false.
<P>
<DT id="4">-H<DD>
Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the command
line arguments.  When
<B>find</B>

examines or prints information about files, the information used
shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.
The only exception to this behaviour is when a file specified on the
command line is a symbolic link,
and the link can be resolved.
For that situation, the information used is taken from whatever the
link points to
(that is, the link is followed).
The information about the link itself is used as a fallback if the
file pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined.
If
<B>-H</B>

is in effect and one of the
paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to a directory,
the contents of that directory will be examined (though of course
-maxdepth 0 would prevent this).
</DL>
<P>

If more than one of
<B>-H</B>,

<B>-L</B>

and
<B>-P</B>

is specified, each overrides the
others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.
Since it is the default, the
<B>-P</B>

option should be considered to be in
effect unless either
<B>-H</B>

or
<B>-L</B>

is specified.
<P>
GNU
<B>find</B>

frequently stats files during the processing of the command line
itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect how
those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of
tests that compare files listed on the command line against a file we
are currently considering.  In each case, the file specified on the
command line will have been examined and some of its properties will
have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and
the
<B>-P</B>

option is in effect (or if neither
<B>-H</B>

nor
<B>-L</B>

were specified), the information used for the comparison will be taken from
the properties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from
the properties of the file the link points to.  If
<B>find</B>

cannot follow the link (for example because it has insufficient
privileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the properties of
the link itself will be used.
<P>

When the
<B>-H</B>

or
<B>-L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed</B>

as the argument of
<B>-newer</B>

will be dereferenced, and the timestamp
will be taken from the file to which the symbolic link points.  The
same consideration applies to
<B>-newerXY</B>,

<B>-anewer</B>

and
<B>-cnewer</B>.

<P>
The
<B>-follow</B>

option has a similar effect to
<B>-L</B>,

though it takes
effect at the point where it appears (that is, if
<B>-L</B>

is not used but
<B>-follow</B>

is, any symbolic links appearing after
<B>-follow</B>

on the
command line will be dereferenced, and those before it will not).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="5">-D debugopts<DD>
Print diagnostic information; this can be helpful to diagnose problems
with why
<B>find</B>

is not doing what you want.  The list of debug options should be comma
separated.  Compatibility of the debug options is not guaranteed
between releases of findutils.  For a complete list of valid debug
options, see the output of
<B>find -D</B>

<B>help</B>.

Valid debug options include
<DL COMPACT><DT id="6"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="7">exec<DD>
Show diagnostic information relating to -exec, -execdir, -ok and -okdir
<DT id="8">opt<DD>
Prints diagnostic information relating to the optimisation of the
expression tree; see the -O option.
<DT id="9">rates<DD>
Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate succeeded or
failed.
<DT id="10">search<DD>
Navigate the directory tree verbosely.
<DT id="11">stat<DD>
Print messages as files are examined with the
<B>stat</B>

and
<B>lstat</B>

system calls.  The
<B>find</B>

program tries to minimise such calls.
<DT id="12">tree<DD>
Show the expression tree in its original and optimised form.
<DT id="13">all<DD>
Enable all of the other debug options (but
<B>help</B>).

<DT id="14">help<DD>
Explain the debugging options.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="15">-Olevel<DD>
Enables query optimisation.
The
<B>find</B>

program reorders tests to speed up execution while preserving the
overall effect; that is, predicates with side effects are not
reordered relative to each other.  The optimisations performed at each
optimisation level are as follows.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="16"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="17">0<DD>
Equivalent to optimisation level 1.
<DT id="18">1<DD>
This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to the
traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so that tests based
only on the names of files (for example
<B>-name</B>

and
<B>-regex</B>)

are performed first.
<DT id="19">2<DD>
Any
<B>-type</B>

or
<B>-xtype</B>

tests are performed after any tests based only on the names of files,
but before any tests that require information from the inode.  On many
modern versions of Unix, file types are returned by
<B>readdir()</B>

and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than predicates which
need to stat the file first.
If you use the
<B>-fstype</B>

<I>FOO</I>

predicate and specify a filesystem type
<I>FOO</I>

which is not known (that is, present in `/etc/mtab') at the time
<B>find</B>

starts, that predicate is equivalent to
<B>-false</B>.

<DT id="20">3<DD>
At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query optimiser is
enabled.  The order of tests is modified so that cheap (i.e. fast)
tests are performed first and more expensive ones are performed later,
if necessary.  Within each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier
or later according to whether they are likely to succeed or not.  For
<B>-o</B>,

predicates which are likely to succeed are evaluated earlier, and for
<B>-a</B>,

predicates which are likely to fail are evaluated earlier.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="21"><DD>
The cost-based optimiser has a fixed idea of how likely any given test
is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes account of the
specific nature of the test (for example,
<B>-type f</B>

is assumed to be more likely to succeed than
<B>-type c</B>).

The cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.
If it does not actually improve the performance of
<B>find</B>,

it will be removed again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be
reliable, robust and effective may be enabled at lower optimisation
levels over time.  However, the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation
level 1) will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The
findutils test suite runs all the tests on
<B>find</B>

at each optimisation level and ensures that the result is the same.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXPRESSION</H2>

The part of the command line after the list of starting points is the
<I>expression</I>.

This is a kind of query specification describing how we match files
and what we do with the files that were matched.
An expression is composed of a sequence of things:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="22">Tests<DD>
Tests return a true or false value, usually on the basis of some
property of a file we are considering.  The
<B>-empty</B>

test for example is true only when the current file is empty.
<P>
<DT id="23">Actions<DD>
Actions have side effects (such as printing something on the standard
output) and return either true or false, usually based on whether or
not they are successful.  The
<B>-print</B>

action for example prints the name of the current file on the standard
output.
<P>
<DT id="24">Global options<DD>
Global options affect the operation of tests and actions specified on
any part of the command line.  Global options always return true.  The
<B>-depth</B>

option for example makes
<B>find</B>

traverse the file system in a depth-first order.
<P>
<DT id="25">Positional options<DD>
Positional options affect only tests or actions which follow them.
Positional options always return true.  The
<B>-regextype</B>

option for example is positional, specifying the regular expression
dialect for regular expressions occurring later on the command line.
<P>
<DT id="26">Operators<DD>
Operators join together the other items within the expression.  They
include for example
<B>-o</B>

(meaning logical OR) and
<B>-a</B>

(meaning logical AND).  Where an operator is missing,
<B>-a</B>

is assumed.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The
<B>-print</B>

action is performed on all files for which the whole expression is
true, unless it contains an action other than
<B>-prune</B>

or
<B>-quit</B>.

Actions which inhibit the default
<B>-print</B>

are
<B>-delete</B>,

<B>-exec</B>,

<B>-execdir</B>,

<B>-ok</B>,

<B>-okdir</B>,

<B>-fls</B>,

<B>-fprint</B>,

<B>-fprintf</B>,

<B>-ls</B>,

<B>-print</B>

and
<B>-printf</B>.

<P>
<P>
The
<B>-delete</B>

action also acts like an option (since it implies
<B>-depth</B>).

<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>POSITIONAL OPTIONS</H3>

Positional options always return true.  They affect only tests occurring
later on the command line.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="27">-daystart<DD>
Measure times (for
<B>-amin</B>,

<B>-atime</B>,

<B>-cmin</B>,

<B>-ctime</B>,

<B>-mmin</B>,

and
<B>-mtime</B>)

from the beginning of today rather than from 24 hours ago.  This
option only affects tests which appear later on the command line.
<P>
<DT id="28">-follow<DD>
Deprecated; use the
<B>-L</B>

option instead.  Dereference symbolic links.
Implies
<B>-noleaf</B>.

The
<B>-follow</B>

option affects only those tests which
appear after it on the command line.  Unless the
<B>-H</B>

or
<B>-L</B>

option has
been specified, the position of the
<B>-follow</B>

option changes the behaviour of the
<B>-newer</B>

predicate; any files listed as the argument
of
<B>-newer</B>

will be dereferenced if they are symbolic links.  The same
consideration applies to
<B>-newerXY</B>,

<B>-anewer</B>

and
<B>-cnewer</B>.

Similarly, the
<B>-type</B>

predicate will always match against the type of the file
that a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself.  Using
<B>-follow</B>

causes the
<B>-lname and</B>

<B>-ilname</B>

predicates always to return false.
<P>
<DT id="29">-regextype <I>type</I><DD>
Changes the regular expression syntax understood by
<B>-regex</B>

and
<B>-iregex</B>

tests which occur later on the command line.  To see which regular
expression types are known, use
<B>-regextype</B>

<B>help</B>.

The Texinfo documentation (see
<B>SEE</B>

<B>ALSO</B>)

explains the meaning of and
differences between the various types of regular expression.
<P>
<DT id="30">-warn, -nowarn<DD>
Turn warning messages on or off.  These warnings apply only to the
command line usage, not to any conditions that
<B>find</B>

might encounter when it searches directories.  The default behaviour
corresponds to
<B>-warn</B>

if standard input is a tty, and to
<B>-nowarn</B>

otherwise.  If a warning message relating to command-line usage is
produced, the exit status of
<B>find</B>

is not affected.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set,
and
<B>-warn</B>

is also used, it is not specified which, if any,
warnings will be active.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>GLOBAL OPTIONS</H3>

Global options always return true.
Global options take effect even for tests which occur earlier on the
command line.  To prevent confusion, global options should specified
on the command-line after the list of start points, just before the
first test, positional option or action.
If you specify a global option in some other place,
<B>find</B>

will issue a warning message explaining that this can be confusing.
<P>
The global options occur after the list of start points, and so are
not the same kind of option as
<B>-L</B>,

for example.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="31">-d<DD>
A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.
<P>
<DT id="32">-depth<DD>
Process each directory's contents before the directory itself.  The
-delete action also implies
<B>-depth</B>.

<P>
<DT id="33">-help, --help<DD>
Print a summary of the command-line usage of
<B>find</B>

and exit.
<P>
<DT id="34">-ignore_readdir_race<DD>
Normally, <B>find</B> will emit an error message when it fails to stat a file.
If you give this option and a file is deleted between the time <B>find</B>
reads the name of the file from the directory and the time it tries to stat
the file, no error message will be issued.
This also applies to files or directories whose names are given on the
command line.
This option takes effect at the time the command line is read,
which means that you cannot search one part of the filesystem with
this option on and part of it with this option off
(if you need to do that, you will need to issue two <B>find</B> commands
instead, one with the option and one without it).
<P>
Furthermore,
<B>find</B>

with the
<B>-ignore_readdir_race</B>

option will ignore errors of the
<B>-delete</B>

action in the case the file has disappeared since the parent directory was read:
it will not output an error diagnostic, and the return code of the
<B>-delete</B>

action will be true.
<P>
<DT id="35">-maxdepth <I>levels</I><DD>
Descend at most <I>levels</I> (a non-negative integer) levels of
directories below the starting-points.
<B>-maxdepth 0</B>

means only apply the tests and actions to the starting-points themselves.
<P>
<DT id="36">-mindepth <I>levels</I><DD>
Do not apply any tests or actions at levels less than <I>levels</I> (a
non-negative integer).
<B>-mindepth 1</B>

means process all files except the starting-points.
<P>
<DT id="37">-mount<DD>
Don't descend directories on other filesystems.  An alternate name for
<B>-xdev</B>,

for compatibility with some other versions of
<B>find</B>.

<P>
<DT id="38">-noignore_readdir_race<DD>
Turns off the effect of
<B>-ignore_readdir_race</B>.

<P>
<DT id="39">-noleaf<DD>
Do not optimize by assuming that directories contain 2 fewer
subdirectories than their hard link count.  This option is needed when
searching filesystems that do not follow the Unix directory-link
convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount
points.  Each directory on a normal Unix filesystem has at least 2
hard links: its name and its `.' entry.  Additionally, its
subdirectories (if any) each have a `..' entry linked to that
directory.  When
<B>find</B>

is examining a directory, after it has statted 2 fewer subdirectories
than the directory's link count, it knows that the rest of the entries
in the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the directory
tree).  If only the files' names need to be examined, there is no need
to stat them; this gives a significant increase in search speed.
<P>
<DT id="40">-version, --version<DD>
Print the <B>find</B> version number and exit.
<P>
<DT id="41">-xdev<DD>
Don't descend directories on other filesystems.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>TESTS</H3>

Some tests, for example
<B>-newerXY</B>

and
<B>-samefile</B>,

allow comparison between the file currently being examined and some
reference file specified on the command line.  When these tests are
used, the interpretation of the reference file is determined by the
options
<B>-H</B>,

<B>-L</B>

and
<B>-P</B>

and any previous
<B>-follow</B>,

but the reference file is only examined once, at the time the command
line is parsed.  If the reference file cannot be examined (for
example, the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+stat">stat</A></B>(2)

system call fails for it), an error message is issued, and
<B>find</B>

exits with a nonzero status.
<P>

Numeric arguments can be specified as

for greater than
<I>n</I>,

<DT id="43"><I>-n</I><DD>

<DT id="45">-amin <I>n</I><DD>
File was last accessed <I>n</I> minutes ago.
<P>
<DT id="46">-anewer <I>reference</I><DD>
Time of the last access of the current file is more recent than that
of the last data modification of the <I>reference</I> file.
If <I>reference</I> is a symbolic link and the
<B>-H</B>

option or the
<B>-L</B>

option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file
it points to is always used.
<P>
<DT id="47">-atime <I>n</I><DD>
File was last accessed
<I>n</I>*24

hours ago.
When find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago the file
was last accessed, any fractional part is ignored, so to match
<B>-atime</B>

<B>+1</B>,

a file has to have been accessed at least
<I>two</I>

days ago.
<P>
<DT id="48">-cmin <I>n</I><DD>
File's status was last changed <I>n</I> minutes ago.
<P>
<DT id="49">-cnewer <I>reference</I><DD>
Time of the last status change of the current file is more recent than that
of the last data modification of the <I>reference</I> file.
If <I>reference</I> is a symbolic link and the
<B>-H</B>

option or the

option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file
it points to is always used.
<P>
<DT id="50">-ctime <I>n</I><DD>
File's status was last changed

hours ago.
See the comments for
<B>-atime</B>

to understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file status
change times.
<P>
<DT id="51">-empty<DD>
File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.
<P>
<DT id="52">-executable<DD>
Matches files which are executable and directories which are
searchable (in a file name resolution sense) by the current user.
This takes into account access control lists and other permissions
artefacts which the
<B>-perm</B>

test ignores.  This test makes use of the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+access">access</A></B>(2)

system call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID
mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems implement
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+access">access</A></B>(2)

in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping
information held on the server.  Because this test is based only on
the result of the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+access">access</A></B>(2)

system call, there is no guarantee that a file for which this test
succeeds can actually be executed.
<P>
<DT id="53">-false<DD>
Always false.
<P>
<DT id="54">-fstype <I>type</I><DD>
File is on a filesystem of type
<I>type</I>.

The valid filesystem types vary among different versions of Unix;
an incomplete list of
filesystem types that are accepted on some version of Unix or another
is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.  You can use
<B>-printf</B>

with the %F directive to see the types of your filesystems.
<P>
<DT id="55">-gid <I>n</I><DD>
File's numeric group ID is
<I>n</I>.

<P>
<DT id="56">-group <I>gname</I><DD>
File belongs to group <I>gname</I> (numeric group ID allowed).
<P>
<DT id="57">-ilname <I>pattern</I><DD>
Like
<B>-lname</B>,

but the match is case insensitive.
If the
<B>-L</B>

option or the
<B>-follow</B>

option is in effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link
is broken.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="58">-iname <I>pattern</I><DD>
Like
<B>-name</B>,

but the match is case insensitive.  For example, the
patterns `fo*' and `F??' match the file names `Foo', `FOO', `foo',
`fOo', etc.
The pattern `*foo*` will also match a file called '.foobar'.
<P>
<DT id="59">-inum <I>n</I><DD>
File has inode number
<I>n</I>.

It is normally easier to use the
<B>-samefile</B>

test instead.

<DT id="60">-ipath <I>pattern</I><DD>
Like

Like
<B>-regex</B>,

but the match is case insensitive.

File has <I>n</I> hard links.
<P>
<DT id="64">-lname <I>pattern</I><DD>
File is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern
<I>pattern</I>.

The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially.
If the

<P>
<DT id="67">-name <I>pattern</I><DD>
Base of file name (the path with the leading directories removed)
matches shell pattern
<I>pattern</I>.

Because the leading directories are removed,
the file names considered for a match with
<B>-name</B>

will never include a slash, so `-name a/b' will never match anything
(you probably need to use
<B>-path</B>

instead).
A warning is issued if you try to do this,
unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.
The metacharacters (`*', `?',
and `[]') match a `.' at the start of the base name (this is a change
in findutils-4.2.2; see section STANDARDS CONFORMANCE below).  To ignore a
directory and the files under it, use
<B>-prune</B>

rather than checking every file in the tree;
see an example in the description of that action.
Braces are not recognised as being
special, despite the fact that some shells including Bash imbue braces
with a special meaning in shell patterns.  The filename matching is
performed with the use of the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+fnmatch">fnmatch</A></B>(3)

library function.
Don't forget to enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it
from expansion by the shell.

<DT id="68">-newer <I>reference</I><DD>

If <I>reference</I> is a symbolic link and the

Some combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid for

Some combinations are not implemented on all systems; for example
<I>B</I>

is not supported on all systems.  If an invalid or unsupported
combination of
<I>XY</I>

is specified, a fatal error results.  Time specifications are
interpreted as for the argument to the
<B>-d</B>

option of GNU
<B>date</B>.

If you try to use the birth time of a reference file, and the birth
time cannot be determined, a fatal error message results.  If you
specify a test which refers to the birth time of files being examined,
this test will fail for any files where the birth time is unknown.

<DT id="70">-nogroup<DD>

<DT id="71">-nouser<DD>
No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.
<P>
<DT id="72">-path <I>pattern</I><DD>
File name matches shell pattern
<I>pattern</I>.

The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially;
so, for example,
<BR>


find . -path &quot;./sr*sc&quot;
<BR>


will print an entry for a directory called `./src/misc' (if one
exists).  To ignore a whole directory tree, use
<B>-prune</B>

rather than
checking every file in the tree.
Note that the pattern match test applies to the whole file name,
starting from one of the start points named on the command line.  It
would only make sense to use an absolute path name here if the
relevant start point is also an absolute path.  This means that this
command will never match anything:
<BR>


find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
<BR>


Find compares the
<B>-path</B>

argument with the concatenation of a directory name and the base name
of the file it's examining.  Since the concatenation will never end
with a slash,
<B>-path</B>

arguments ending in a slash will match nothing (except perhaps a start
point specified on the command line).
The predicate
<B>-path</B>

is also supported by HP-UX
<B>find</B>

and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.
<P>
<DT id="73">-perm <I>mode</I><DD>
File's permission bits are exactly <I>mode</I> (octal or symbolic).
Since an exact match is required, if you want to use this form for
symbolic modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode string.
For example `-perm g=w' will only match files which have mode 0020
(that is, ones for which group write permission is the only permission
set).  It is more likely that you will want to use the `/' or `-'
forms, for example `-perm -g=w', which matches any file with group
write permission.  See the
<B>EXAMPLES</B>

section for some illustrative examples.
<P>
<DT id="74">-perm -<I>mode</I><DD>
All of the permission bits <I>mode</I> are set for the file.
Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this is usually the way
in which you would want to use them.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if
you use a symbolic mode.
See the
<B>EXAMPLES</B>

section for some illustrative examples.
<P>
<DT id="75">-perm /<I>mode</I><DD>
Any of the permission bits <I>mode</I> are set for the file.  Symbolic
modes are accepted in this form.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if
you use a symbolic mode.  See the
<B>EXAMPLES</B>

section for some illustrative examples.  If no permission bits in
<I>mode</I>

are set, this test matches any file (the idea here is to be consistent
with the behaviour of
<B>-perm</B>

<B>-000</B>).

<P>
<DT id="76">-perm +<I>mode</I><DD>
This is no longer supported (and has been deprecated since 2005).  Use
<B>-perm /</B><I>mode</I>

instead.
<P>
<DT id="77">-readable<DD>
Matches files which are readable by the current user.  This takes into
account access control lists and other permissions artefacts which the
<B>-perm</B>

test ignores.  This test makes use of the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+access">access</A></B>(2)

system call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID
mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems implement
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+access">access</A></B>(2)

in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping
information held on the server.
<P>
<DT id="78">-regex <I>pattern</I><DD>
File name matches regular expression
<I>pattern</I>.

This is a match on the whole path, not a search.
For example, to match a file named `./fubar3',
you can use the regular expression `.*bar.' or `.*b.*3',
but not `f.*r3'.
The regular expressions understood by
<B>find</B>

are by default Emacs Regular Expressions (except that `.' matches
newline), but this can be changed with the
<B>-regextype</B>

option.
<P>
<DT id="79">-samefile <I>name</I><DD>

<DT id="80">-size <I>n</I>[cwbkMG]<DD>
File uses <I>n</I> units of space, rounding up.  The following suffixes
can be used:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="81"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="82">`b'<DD>
for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is used)
<DT id="83">`c'<DD>
for bytes
<DT id="84">`w'<DD>
for two-byte words
<DT id="85">`k'<DD>
for kibibytes (KiB, units of 1024 bytes)
<DT id="86">`M'<DD>
for mebibytes (MiB, units of 1024 * 1024 = 1048576 bytes)
<DT id="87">`G'<DD>
for gibibytes (GiB, units of 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1073741824 bytes)
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="88"><DD>
The size is simply the st_size member of the struct stat populated by
the lstat (or stat) system call, rounded up as shown above.
In other words, it's consistent with the result you get for
<B>ls -l</B>.

Bear in
mind that the `%k' and `%b' format specifiers of
<B>-printf</B>

handle sparse files
differently.  The `b' suffix always denotes 512-byte blocks and never
1024-byte blocks, which is different to the behaviour of
<B>-ls</B>.

<DT id="89"><DD>
The + and - prefixes signify greater than and less than, as usual;
i.e., an exact size of <I>n</I> units does not match.
Bear in mind that the size is rounded up to the next unit.
Therefore
<B>-size -1M</B>

is not equivalent to
<B>-size -1048576c.</B>

The former only matches empty files, the latter matches files from 0 to
1,048,575 bytes.

If

Use of
<B>-delete</B>

automatically turns on the
`<B>-depth</B>'

option.
<P>
<B>Warnings</B>:

Don't forget that the find command line is
evaluated as an expression, so putting
<B>-delete</B>

first will make
<B>find</B>

try to delete everything below the starting points you specified.
When testing a
<B>find</B>

command line that you later intend to use with
<B>-delete</B>,

you should explicitly specify
<B>-depth</B>

in order to avoid later surprises.  Because
<B>-delete</B>

implies
<B>-depth</B>,

you cannot usefully use
<B>-prune</B>

and
<B>-delete</B>

together.
<P>
Together with the
<B>-ignore_readdir_race</B>

option,
<B>find</B>

will ignore errors of the

<DT id="110">-exec <I>command</I> ;<DD>
Execute
<I>command</I>;

true if 0 status is returned.  All following
arguments to

are taken to be arguments to the command until an argument consisting
of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced by the current
file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the
command, not just in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions
of
<B>find</B>.

Both of these constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\') or
quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the
<B>EXAMPLES</B>

section for examples of the use of the
<B>-exec</B>

option.  The specified
command is run once for each matched file.
The command is executed in the starting directory.
There are unavoidable security problems surrounding use of the

you should use the

option instead.
<P>
<DT id="111">-exec <I>command</I> {} +<DD>
This variant of the
<B>-exec</B>

action runs the specified command on the
selected files, but the command line is built by appending each
selected file name at the end; the total number of invocations of the
command will be much less than the number of matched files.  The
command line is built in much the same way that
<B>xargs</B>

builds its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is allowed within
the command, and (when
<B>find</B>

is being invoked from a shell) it should be quoted (for
example, '{}') to protect it from interpretation by shells.  The
command is executed in the starting directory.  If any invocation
with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then
<B>find</B>

returns a non-zero exit status.  If
<B>find</B>

encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an
immediate exit, so some pending commands may not be run
at all.  This variant of
<B>-exec</B>

always returns true.
<P>
<DT id="112">-execdir <I>command</I> ;<DD>
<DT id="113">-execdir <I>command</I> {} +<DD>
Like
<B>-exec</B>,

but the specified command is run from the subdirectory
containing the matched file, which is not normally the directory in
which you started
<B>find</B>.

As with -exec, the {} should be quoted if find is being invoked from
a shell.
This a much more secure method for invoking commands, as it avoids
race conditions during resolution of the paths to the matched files.
As with the
<B>-exec</B>

action, the `+' form of
<B>-execdir</B>

will build a
command line to process more than one matched file, but any given
invocation of
<I>command</I>

will only list files that exist in the same subdirectory.  If you use
this option, you must ensure that your
<B>$PATH</B>

environment variable does not reference `.';
otherwise, an attacker can run any commands they like by leaving an
appropriately-named file in a directory in which you will run
<B>-execdir</B>.

The same applies to having entries in
<B>$PATH</B>

which are empty or which are not absolute directory names.  If
any invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status,
then
<B>find</B>

returns a non-zero exit status.  If
<B>find</B>

encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an
immediate exit, so some pending commands may not be run
at all.
The result of the action depends on whether the

<DT id="170">%b<DD>
The amount of disk space used for this file in 512-byte blocks.  Since disk
space is allocated in multiples of the filesystem block size this is usually
greater than %s/512, but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.
<DT id="171">%c<DD>
File's last status change time in the format returned by the C `ctime'
function.
<DT id="172">%C<I>k</I><DD>
File's last status change time in the format specified by
<I>k</I>,

which is the same as for %A.
<DT id="173">%d<DD>
File's depth in the directory tree; 0 means the file is a starting-point.
<DT id="174">%D<DD>
The device number on which the file exists (the st_dev field of struct
stat), in decimal.
<DT id="175">%f<DD>
File's name with any leading directories removed (only the last element).
<DT id="176">%F<DD>
Type of the filesystem the file is on; this value can be used for
-fstype.
<DT id="177">%g<DD>
File's group name, or numeric group ID if the group has no name.
<DT id="178">%G<DD>
File's numeric group ID.
<DT id="179">%h<DD>
Leading directories of file's name (all but the last element).
If the file name contains no slashes (since it is in the current
directory) the %h specifier expands to `.'.
<DT id="180">%H<DD>
Starting-point under which file was found.
<DT id="181">%i<DD>
File's inode number (in decimal).
<DT id="182">%k<DD>
The amount of disk space used for this file in 1&nbsp;KB blocks.
Since disk space is allocated in multiples of the filesystem block
size this is usually greater than %s/1024,
but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.
<DT id="183">%l<DD>
Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not a symbolic link).
<DT id="184">%m<DD>
File's permission bits (in octal).  This option uses the `traditional'
numbers which most Unix implementations use, but if your particular
implementation uses an unusual ordering of octal permissions bits, you
will see a difference between the actual value of the file's mode and
the output of %m.
Normally you will want to have a leading zero on this number,
and to do this, you should use the
<B>#</B>

flag (as in, for example, `%#m').
<DT id="185">%M<DD>
File's permissions (in symbolic form, as for
<B>ls</B>).

This directive is supported in findutils 4.2.5 and later.
<DT id="186">%n<DD>
Number of hard links to file.
<DT id="187">%p<DD>
File's name.
<DT id="188">%P<DD>
File's name with the name of the starting-point under which
it was found removed.
<DT id="189">%s<DD>
File's size in bytes.
<DT id="190">%S<DD>
File's sparseness.  This is calculated as (BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks /
st_size).  The exact value you will get for an ordinary file of a
certain length is system-dependent.  However, normally sparse files
will have values less than 1.0, and files which use indirect blocks
may have a value which is greater than 1.0.  In general the number of
blocks used by a file is file system dependent.
The value used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent, but is usually 512
bytes.
If the file size is zero, the value printed is undefined.
On systems which lack support for st_blocks,
a file's sparseness is assumed to be 1.0.
<DT id="191">%t<DD>
File's last modification time in the format returned by the C `ctime'
function.
<DT id="192">%T<I>k</I><DD>
File's last modification time in the format specified by
<I>k</I>,

which is the same as for %A.
<DT id="193">%u<DD>
File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has no name.
<DT id="194">%U<DD>
File's numeric user ID.
<DT id="195">%y<DD>
File's type (like in
<B>ls -l</B>),

U=unknown type (shouldn't happen)
<DT id="196">%Y<DD>
File's type (like %y), plus follow symlinks: `L'=loop, `N'=nonexistent, `?' for
any other error when determining the type of the symlink target.
<DT id="197">%Z<DD>
(SELinux only) file's security context.
<DT id="198">%{ %[ %(<DD>
Reserved for future use.
</DL>
<P>

A `%' character followed by any other character is discarded, but the
other character is printed (don't rely on this, as further format
characters may be introduced).  A `%' at the end of the format
argument causes undefined behaviour since there is no following
character.  In some locales, it may hide your door keys, while in
others it may remove the final page from the novel you are reading.
<P>
The %m and %d directives support the
<B>#</B>

,
<B>0</B>

and
<B>+</B>

flags, but the other directives do not, even if they
print numbers.  Numeric directives that do not support these flags
include
<B>G</B>,

<B>U</B>,

<B>b</B>,

<B>D</B>,

<B>k</B>

and
<B>n</B>.

The `-' format flag is supported and changes the alignment of a field
from right-justified (which is the default) to left-justified.
<P>

See the
<B>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</B>

section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.
<P>
<P>
</DL>

<DT id="199">-prune<DD>
True; if the file is a directory, do not descend into it.  If
<B>-depth</B>

is given, then
<B>-prune</B>

has no effect.  Because
<B>-delete</B>

implies
<B>-depth</B>,

you cannot usefully use
<B>-prune</B>

and
<B>-delete</B>

together.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;example,&nbsp;to&nbsp;skip&nbsp;the
directory `src/emacs' and all files and directories under it, and

<BR>


find . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print
<BR>


<P>
<P>
<DT id="200">-quit<DD>
Exit immediately.  No child processes will be left running, but no more
paths specified on the command line will be processed.  For example,
<B>find /tmp/foo /tmp/bar -print -quit</B>

will print only
<B>/tmp/foo</B>.

Any command lines which have been built up with
<B>-execdir ... {} +</B>

will be invoked before
<B>find</B>

exits.
The exit status may or may not be zero,
depending on whether an error has already occurred.

<H3>OPERATORS</H3>

<P>

Listed in order of decreasing precedence:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="201">( <I>expr</I> )<DD>
Force precedence.  Since parentheses are special to the shell, you
will normally need to quote them.  Many of the examples in this manual
page use backslashes for this purpose: `\(...\)' instead of `(...)'.
<P>
<DT id="202">! <I>expr</I><DD>
True if <I>expr</I> is false.  This character will also usually need
protection from interpretation by the shell.
<P>
<DT id="203">-not <I>expr</I><DD>
Same as !
<I>expr</I>,

but not POSIX compliant.
<P>
<DT id="204"><I>expr1 expr2</I><DD>
Two expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an
implied
<B>-a</B>;

<I>expr2</I> is not evaluated if <I>expr1</I> is false.
<P>
<DT id="205"><I>expr1</I> -a <I>expr2</I><DD>
Same as
<I>expr1 expr2</I>.

<P>
<DT id="206"><I>expr1</I> -and <I>expr2</I><DD>
Same as
<I>expr1 expr2</I>,

but not POSIX compliant.
<P>
<DT id="207"><I>expr1</I> -o <I>expr2</I><DD>
Or; <I>expr2</I> is not evaluated if <I>expr1</I> is true.
<P>
<DT id="208"><I>expr1</I> -or <I>expr2</I><DD>
Same as <I>expr1</I>
<B>-o</B>

<I>expr2</I>,

but not POSIX compliant.
<P>
<DT id="209"><I>expr1</I> , <I>expr2</I><DD>
List; both <I>expr1</I> and <I>expr2</I> are always evaluated.  The
value of <I>expr1</I> is discarded; the value of the list is the value
of
<I>expr2</I>.

The comma operator can be useful for searching for
several different types of thing, but traversing the filesystem
hierarchy only once.  The
<B>-fprintf</B>

action can be used to list the various matched items into several
different output files.
</DL>
<P>

Please note that
<B>-a</B>

when specified implicitly (for example by two tests appearing without
an explicit operator between them) or explicitly has higher precedence
than
<B>-o</B>.

This means that
<B>find . -name afile -o -name bfile -print</B>

will never print
<I>afile</I>.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</H2>

Many of the actions of
<B>find</B>

result in the printing of data which is under the control of other
users.  This includes file names, sizes, modification times and so
forth.  File names are a potential problem since they can contain any
character except `\0' and `/'.  Unusual characters in file names can
do unexpected and often undesirable things to your terminal (for
example, changing the settings of your function keys on some
terminals).  Unusual characters are handled differently by various
actions, as described below.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="210">-print0, -fprint0<DD>
Always print the exact filename, unchanged, even if the output is
going to a terminal.
<P>
<DT id="211">-ls, -fls<DD>
Unusual characters are always escaped.  White space, backslash, and
double quote characters are printed using C-style escaping (for
example `\f', `\&quot;').  Other unusual characters are printed using an
octal escape.  Other printable characters (for
<B>-ls</B>

and
<B>-fls</B>

these are the characters between octal 041 and 0176) are printed as-is.
<P>
<DT id="212">-printf, -fprintf<DD>
If the output is not going to a terminal, it is printed as-is.
Otherwise, the result depends on which directive is in use.  The
directives %D, %F, %g, %G, %H, %Y, and %y expand to values which are
not under control of files' owners, and so are printed as-is.  The
directives %a, %b, %c, %d, %i, %k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u and %U have
values which are under the control of files' owners but which cannot
be used to send arbitrary data to the terminal, and so these are
printed as-is.  The directives %f, %h, %l, %p and %P are quoted.  This
quoting is performed in the same way as for GNU
<B>ls</B>.

This is not the same quoting mechanism as the one used for
<B>-ls</B>

and
<B>-fls</B>.

If you are able to decide what format to use for the output of
<B>find</B>

then it is normally better to use `\0' as a terminator
than to use newline, as file names can contain white space and newline
characters.  The setting of the `LC_CTYPE' environment
variable is used to determine which characters need to be quoted.
<P>
<DT id="213">-print, -fprint<DD>
Quoting is handled in the same way as for
<B>-printf</B>

and
<B>-fprintf</B>.

If you are using
<B>find</B>

in a script or in a situation where the matched files might have
arbitrary names, you should consider using
<B>-print0</B>

instead of
<B>-print</B>.

</DL>
<P>

The
<B>-ok</B>

and
<B>-okdir</B>

actions print the current filename as-is.  This may change in a future release.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STANDARDS CONFORMANCE</H2>

For closest compliance to the POSIX standard, you should set the
POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable.  The following options are
specified in the POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition):
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="214"><B>-H</B><DD>
This option is supported.
<P>
<DT id="215"><B>-L</B><DD>
This option is supported.
<P>
<DT id="216"><B>-name</B><DD>
This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the
POSIX conformance of the system's
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+fnmatch">fnmatch</A></B>(3)

library function.  As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters
(`*', `?' or `[]' for example) will match a leading `.', because
IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this.
This is a change from previous versions of findutils.
<P>
<DT id="217"><B>-type</B><DD>
Supported.
POSIX specifies `b', `c', `d', `l', `p', `f' and `s'.
GNU find also supports `D', representing a Door, where the OS provides these.
Furthermore, GNU find allows multiple types to be specified at once in a
comma-separated list.
<P>
<DT id="218"><B>-ok</B><DD>
Supported.
Interpretation of the response is according to the `yes' and `no'
patterns selected by setting the `LC_MESSAGES' environment variable.
When the `POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment variable is set, these patterns
are taken system's definition of a positive (yes) or negative (no)
response.  See the system's
documentation for <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+nl_langinfo">nl_langinfo</A></B>(3), in particular YESEXPR and
NOEXPR.
When `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is not set, the patterns are instead taken from
<B>find</B>'s

own message catalogue.
<P>
<DT id="219"><B>-newer</B><DD>
Supported.  If the file specified is a symbolic link, it is always
dereferenced.  This is a change from previous behaviour, which used to
take the relevant time from the symbolic link; see the HISTORY section
below.
<P>
<DT id="220"><B>-perm</B><DD>
Supported.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is not set,
some mode arguments (for example +a+x) which are not valid in POSIX
are supported for backward-compatibility.
<P>
<DT id="221">Other primaries<DD>

and

are all supported.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(', `)', negation `!' and the
`and' and `or' operators (
<B>-a</B>,

<B>-o</B>).

<P>

All other options, predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions
beyond the POSIX standard.  Many of these extensions are not unique to
GNU find, however.
<P>

The POSIX standard requires that
<B>find</B>

detects loops:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="222"><DD>
The
<B>find</B>

utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, find shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its
position in the hierarchy or terminate.
</DL>
<P>

GNU
<B>find</B>

complies with these requirements.  The link count of
directories which contain entries which are hard links to an ancestor
will often be lower than they otherwise should be.  This can mean that
GNU find will sometimes optimise away the visiting of a subdirectory
which is actually a link to an ancestor.  Since
<B>find</B>

does not actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid
emitting a diagnostic message.  Although this behaviour may be
somewhat confusing, it is unlikely that anybody actually depends on
this behaviour.  If the leaf optimisation has been turned off with
<B>-noleaf</B>,

the directory entry will always be examined and the diagnostic message
will be issued where it is appropriate.  Symbolic links cannot be used
to create filesystem cycles as such, but if the
<B>-L</B>

option or the
<B>-follow</B>

option is in use, a diagnostic message is issued when
<B>find</B>

encounters a loop of symbolic links.  As with loops containing hard
links, the leaf optimisation will often mean that
<B>find</B>

knows that it doesn't need to call
<I>stat()</I>

or
<I>chdir()</I>

on the symbolic link, so this diagnostic is frequently not necessary.
<P>

The
<B>-d</B>

option is supported for compatibility with various BSD systems,
but you should use the POSIX-compliant option
<B>-depth</B>

instead.
<P>

The POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable does not affect the behaviour
of the
<B>-regex</B>

or
<B>-iregex</B>

tests because those tests aren't specified in the POSIX standard.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="223">LANG<DD>
Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null.

<DT id="224">LC_ALL<DD>
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
<P>
<DT id="225">LC_COLLATE<DD>
The POSIX standard specifies that this variable affects the pattern
matching to be used for the
<B>-name</B>

option.
GNU find uses the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+fnmatch">fnmatch</A></B>(3)

library function, and so support for `LC_COLLATE' depends on the
system library.
This variable also affects the interpretation of the response to
<B>-ok</B>;

while the `LC_MESSAGES' variable selects the actual pattern used to
interpret the response to
<B>-ok</B>,

the interpretation of any bracket expressions in the pattern will be
affected by `LC_COLLATE'.
<P>
<DT id="226">LC_CTYPE<DD>
This variable affects the treatment of character classes used in
regular expressions and also with
the
<B>-name</B>

test, if the system's
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+fnmatch">fnmatch</A></B>(3)

library function supports this.  This variable also affects the
interpretation of any character classes in the regular expressions
used to interpret the response to the prompt issued by
<B>-ok</B>.

The `LC_CTYPE' environment variable will
also affect which characters are considered to be unprintable when
filenames are printed; see the section UNUSUAL FILENAMES.
<P>
<DT id="227">LC_MESSAGES<DD>
Determines the locale to be used for internationalised messages.  If
the `POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment variable is set, this also
determines the interpretation of the response to the prompt made by the
<B>-ok</B>

action.
<P>
<DT id="228">NLSPATH<DD>
Determines the location of the internationalisation message catalogues.
<P>
<DT id="229">PATH<DD>

<B>-exec</B>,

<B>-execdir</B>,

<B>-ok</B>

and
<B>-okdir</B>.

<P>
<DT id="230">POSIXLY_CORRECT<DD>
Determines the block size used by
<B>-ls</B>

and
<B>-fls</B>.

If
<B>POSIXLY_CORRECT</B>

is set, blocks are units of 512 bytes.  Otherwise they are units of 1024 bytes.
<DT id="231"><DD>
Setting this variable also turns off
warning messages (that is, implies
<B>-nowarn</B>)

by default, because POSIX requires that apart from
the output for
<B>-ok</B>,

all messages printed on stderr are diagnostics and must result in a
non-zero exit status.
<DT id="232"><DD>
When POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set,
<B>-perm</B>

+zzz
is treated just like
<B>-perm</B>

/zzz
if
+zzz is not a valid symbolic mode.  When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, such
constructs are treated as an error.
<DT id="233"><DD>
When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, the response to the prompt made by the
<B>-ok</B>

action is interpreted according to the system's message catalogue, as
opposed to according to
<B>find</B>'s

own message translations.

Find files named

and delete them, processing filenames in such a way that file or
directory names containing single or double quotes, spaces or newlines
are correctly handled.  The

Runs `file' on every file in or below the current directory.  Notice
that the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to protect them
from interpretation as shell script punctuation.  The semicolon is
similarly protected by the use of a backslash, though single quotes
could have been used in that case also.

and large files into
<B>/root/big.txt</B>.

<P>
<P>

<PRE>
<B>find $HOME  -mtime 0</B>

</PRE>

Search for files in your home directory which have been modified in
the last twenty-four hours.  This command works this way because the
time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and any
remainder is discarded.  That means that to match
<B>-mtime</B>

<B>0</B>,

a file will have to have a modification in the past which is less than
24 hours ago.
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
<B>find /sbin /usr/sbin -executable \! -readable -print</B>

</PRE>

Search for files which are executable but not readable.
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
<B>find . -perm 664</B>

</PRE>

Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner,
and group, but which other users can read but not write to.  Files
which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for
example if someone can execute the file) will not be matched.
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
<B>find . -perm -664</B>

</PRE>

Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner
and group, and which other users can read, without regard to the
presence of any extra permission bits (for example the executable
bit).  This will match a file which has mode 0777, for example.
<P>

<PRE>
<B>find . -perm /222</B>

</PRE>

Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner, or
their group, or anybody else).

<B>find . -perm /220</B>
<B>find . -perm /u+w,g+w</B>
<B>find . -perm /u=w,g=w</B>

All three of these commands do the same thing, but the first one uses
the octal representation of the file mode, and the other two use the
symbolic form.  These commands all search for files which are
writable by either their owner or their group.  The files don't have
to be writable by both the owner and group to be matched; either will
do.

<PRE>
<B>find . -perm -220</B>

<B>find . -perm -444 -perm /222 \! -perm /111</B>
<B>find . -perm -a+r -perm /a+w \! -perm /a+x</B>

</PRE>

These two commands both search for files that are readable for
everybody (
<B>-perm -444</B>

or
<B>-perm -a+r</B>),

have at least one write bit
set (
<B>-perm /222</B>

or
<B>-perm /a+w</B>)

but are not executable for anybody (
<B>! -perm /111</B>

and
<B>! -perm /a+x</B>

respectively).
<P>

<PRE>
<B>cd /source-dir</B>
<B>find . -name .snapshot -prune -o \( \! -name '*~' -print0 \)|</B>
<B>cpio -pmd0   /dest-dir</B>

</PRE>

This command copies the contents of
<B>/source-dir</B>

to
<B>/dest-dir</B>,

but omits files and directories named
<B>.snapshot</B>

(and anything in them).  It also omits files or directories whose name
ends in
<B>~</B>,

but not their contents.  The construct
<B>-prune -o \( ... -print0 \)</B>

is quite common.  The idea here is that the expression before
<B>-prune</B>

matches things which are to be pruned.  However, the
<B>-prune</B>

action itself returns true, so the following
<B>-o</B>

ensures that the right hand side is evaluated only for those
directories which didn't get pruned (the contents of the pruned
directories are not even visited, so their contents are irrelevant).
The expression on the right hand side of the
<B>-o</B>

is in parentheses only for clarity.  It emphasises that the
<B>-print0</B>

action takes place only for things that didn't have
<B>-prune</B>

applied to them.  Because the default `and' condition between tests
binds more tightly than
<B>-o</B>,

this is the default anyway, but the parentheses help to show
what is going on.

<PRE>
<B>find repo/ \( -exec test -d '{}'/.svn \; -or \</B>
<B>-exec test -d {}/.git \; -or -exec test -d {}/CVS \; \) \</B>
<B>-print -prune</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Given the following directory of projects and their associated SCM
administrative directories, perform an efficient search for the
projects' roots:
<P>
<PRE>
<B>repo/project1/CVS</B>
<B>repo/gnu/project2/.svn</B>
<B>repo/gnu/project3/.svn</B>
<B>repo/gnu/project3/src/.svn</B>
<B>repo/project4/.git</B>

</PRE>

In this example,
<B>-prune</B>

prevents unnecessary descent into directories that have already been
discovered (for example we do not search project3/src because we
already found project3/.svn), but ensures sibling directories
(project2 and project3) are found.
<P>
<P>

<PRE>
<B>find /tmp -type f,d,l</B>
</PRE>

<P>
Search for files, directories, and symbolic links in the directory
<B>/tmp</B>

passing these types as a comma-separated list (GNU extension),
which is otherwise equivalent to the longer, yet more portable:
<P>
<PRE>
<B>find /tmp \( -type f -o -type d -o -type l \)</B>
</PRE>

<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2>

<P>

<B>find</B>

exits with status 0 if all files are processed successfully, greater
than 0 if errors occur.
This is deliberately a very broad description,
but if the return value is non-zero,
you should not rely on the correctness of the results of
<B>find</B>.

<P>
When some error occurs,
<B>find</B>

may stop immediately, without completing all the actions specified.
For example, some starting points may not have been examined or some
pending program invocations for
<B>-exec ... {} +</B>

or
<B>-execdir ... {} +</B>

may not have been performed.

<H2>HISTORY</H2>

As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for
example) used in filename patterns will match a leading `.', because
IEEE POSIX interpretation 126 requires this.
<P>

As of findutils-4.3.3,
<B>-perm /000</B>

now matches all files instead of none.
<P>

Nanosecond-resolution
timestamps were implemented in findutils-4.3.3.
<P>

As of findutils-4.3.11, the
<B>-delete</B>

action sets
<B>find</B>'s

exit status to a nonzero value when it fails.
However,
<B>find</B>

will not exit immediately.  Previously,
<B>find</B>'s

exit status was unaffected by the failure of
<B>-delete</B>.

The syntax
.B -perm +MODE
was removed in findutils-4.5.12, in favour of
.B -perm
<B>/MODE</B>.

The
<B>+MODE</B>

syntax had been deprecated since findutils-4.2.21
which was released in 2005.

<H3>Operator precedence surprises</H3>

The command
<B>find . -name afile -o -name bfile -print</B>

will never print
<I>afile</I>

because this is actually equivalent to
<B>find . -name afile -o \( -name bfile -a -print \)</B>.

Remember that the precedence of
<B>-a</B>

is higher than that of
<B>-o</B>

and when there is no operator specified between tests,
<B>-a</B>

is assumed.
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>"paths must precede expression" error message</H3>

<PRE>
<B>$ find . -name *.c -print</B>
find: paths must precede expression
find: possible unquoted pattern after predicate `-name'?
</PRE>

<P>

This happens when the shell could expand the pattern
<I>*.c</I>

to more than one file name existing in the current directory,
and passing the resulting file names in the command line to
<B>find</B>

like this:
<PRE>
<B>find . -name frcode.c locate.c word_io.c -print</B>
</PRE>

That command is of course not going to work, because the
<B>-name</B>

predicate allows exactly only one pattern as argument.  Instead of doing things
this way, you should enclose the pattern in quotes or escape the wildcard, thus
allowing
<B>find</B>

to use the pattern with the wildcard during the search for file name matching
instead of file names expanded by the parent shell:
<PRE>
<B>$ find . -name '*.c' -print</B>
<B>$ find . -name \*.c -print</B>
</PRE>

There are security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX

should be used instead.
