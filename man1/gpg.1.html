<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>gpg</B> is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It
is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the
OpenPGP standard. <B>gpg</B> features complete key management and
all the bells and whistles you would expect from a full OpenPGP
implementation.
<P>
There are two main versions of GnuPG: GnuPG 1.x and GnuPG 2.x.  GnuPG
2.x supports modern encryption algorithms and thus should be preferred
over GnuPG 1.x.  You only need to use GnuPG 1.x if your platform
doesn't support GnuPG 2.x, or you need support for some features that
GnuPG 2.x has deprecated, e.g., decrypting data created with PGP-2
keys.
<P>
If you are looking for version 1 of GnuPG, you may find that version
installed under the name <B>gpg1</B>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<P>
The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least
a signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WARNINGS</H2>

<P>
Use a *good* password for your user account and a *good* passphrase
to protect your secret key. This passphrase is the weakest part of the
whole system. Programs to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring
are very easy to write and so you should protect your &quot;~/.gnupg/&quot;
directory very well.
<P>
Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a network (telnet), it
is *very* easy to spy out your passphrase!
<P>
If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the
program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line
or use '-' to specify STDIN.
<P>
For scripted or other unattended use of <B>gpg</B> make sure to use
the machine-parseable interface and not the default interface which is
intended for direct use by humans.  The machine-parseable interface
provides a stable and well documented API independent of the locale or
future changes of <B>gpg</B>.  To enable this interface use the
options <B>--with-colons</B> and <B>--status-fd</B>.  For certain
operations the option <B>--command-fd</B> may come handy too.  See
this man page and the file '<I>DETAILS</I>' for the specification of the
interface.  Note that the GnuPG ``info'' pages as well as the PDF
version of the GnuPG manual features a chapter on unattended use of
GnuPG.  As an alternative the library <B>GPGME</B> can be used as a
high-level abstraction on top of that interface.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INTEROPERABILITY</H2>

<P>
GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP
standard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts
of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2
compression algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all
OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms and that by
forcing their use via the <B>--cipher-algo</B>,
<B>--digest-algo</B>, <B>--cert-digest-algo</B>, or
<B>--compress-algo</B> options in GnuPG, it is possible to create a
perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that cannot be read by the
intended recipient.
<P>
There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and each
supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms.
For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported
the BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could
not be read by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard
OpenPGP preferences system that will always do the right thing and
create messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which
OpenPGP program they use. Only override this safe default if you
really know what you are doing.
<P>
If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the preferences
on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far better off using
the <B>--pgp6</B>, <B>--pgp7</B>, or <B>--pgp8</B> options. These
options are safe as they do not force any particular algorithms in
violation of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available algorithms to a
&quot;PGP-safe&quot; list.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMANDS</H2>

<P>
Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.  Generally speaking, irrelevant options
are silently ignored, and may not be checked for correctness.
<P>
<B>gpg</B> may be run with no commands. In this case it will
print a warning perform a reasonable action depending on the type of
file it is given as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a
signature is verified, a file containing keys is listed, etc.).
<P>
If you run into any problems, please add the option <B>--verbose</B>
to the invocation to see more diagnostics.

(though you can use its short form <B>-h</B>).
<P>
<DT id="3"><B>--warranty</B>

<DD>
Print warranty information.

<H3>Commands to select the type of operation</H3>

&nbsp;
<P>
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="5"><B>--sign</B>

<DD>

<B>-s</B>

Sign a message. This command may be combined with <B>--encrypt</B>
(to sign and encrypt a message), <B>--symmetric</B> (to sign and
symmetrically encrypt a message), or both <B>--encrypt</B> and
<B>--symmetric</B> (to sign and encrypt a message that can be
decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase).  The signing key is
chosen by default or can be set explicitly using the
<B>--local-user</B> and <B>--default-key</B> options.
<P>
<DT id="6"><B>--clear-sign</B>

<DD>

<B>--clearsign</B>

Make a cleartext signature.  The content in a cleartext signature is
readable without any special software. OpenPGP software is only needed
to verify the signature.  cleartext signatures may modify end-of-line
whitespace for platform independence and are not intended to be
reversible.  The signing key is chosen by default or can be set
explicitly using the <B>--local-user</B> and <B>--default-key</B>
options.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="7"><B>--detach-sign</B>

<DD>

<B>-b</B>

Make a detached signature.
<P>
<DT id="8"><B>--encrypt</B>

<DD>

<B>-e</B>

Encrypt data to one or more public keys. This command may be combined
with <B>--sign</B> (to sign and encrypt a message),
<B>--symmetric</B> (to encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a
secret key or a passphrase), or <B>--sign</B> and
<B>--symmetric</B> together (for a signed message that can be
decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase).  <B>--recipient</B>
and related options specify which public keys to use for encryption.
<P>
<DT id="9"><B>--symmetric</B>

<DD>

<B>-c</B>

Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default
symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may be chosen with the
<B>--cipher-algo</B> option. This command may be combined with
<B>--sign</B> (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message),
<B>--encrypt</B> (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key
or a passphrase), or <B>--sign</B> and <B>--encrypt</B> together
(for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a
passphrase).  <B>gpg</B> caches the passphrase used for
symmetric encryption so that a decrypt operation may not require that
the user needs to enter the passphrase.  The option
<B>--no-symkey-cache</B> can be used to disable this feature.
<P>
<DT id="10"><B>--store</B>

<DD>
Store only (make a simple literal data packet).
<P>
<DT id="11"><B>--decrypt</B>

<DD>

<B>-d</B>

Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file
is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with
<B>--output</B>). If the decrypted file is signed, the signature is also
verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never
writes to the filename which is included in the file and it rejects
files that don't begin with an encrypted message.
<P>
<DT id="12"><B>--verify</B>

<DD>
Assume that the first argument is a signed file and verify it without
generating any output.  With no arguments, the signature packet is
read from STDIN.  If only one argument is given, the specified file is
expected to include a complete signature.
<P>
With more than one argument, the first argument should specify a file
with a detached signature and the remaining files should contain the
signed data. To read the signed data from STDIN, use '-' as the
second filename.  For security reasons, a detached signature will not
read the signed material from STDIN if not explicitly specified.
<P>
Note: If the option <B>--batch</B> is not used, <B>gpg</B>
may assume that a single argument is a file with a detached signature,
and it will try to find a matching data file by stripping certain
suffixes.  Using this historical feature to verify a detached
signature is strongly discouraged; you should always specify the data file
explicitly.
<P>
Note: When verifying a cleartext signature, <B>gpg</B> verifies
only what makes up the cleartext signed data and not any extra data
outside of the cleartext signature or the header lines directly following
the dash marker line.  The option <B>--output</B> may be used to write
out the actual signed data, but there are other pitfalls with this
format as well.  It is suggested to avoid cleartext signatures in
favor of detached signatures.
<P>
Note: Sometimes the use of the <B>gpgv</B> tool is easier than
using the full-fledged <B>gpg</B> with this option.  <B>gpgv</B>
is designed to compare signed data against a list of trusted keys and
returns with success only for a good signature.  It has its own manual
page.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="13"><B>--multifile</B>

<DD>
This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for
processing on the command line or read from STDIN with each filename on
a separate line. This allows for many files to be processed at
once. <B>--multifile</B> may currently be used along with
<B>--verify</B>, <B>--encrypt</B>, and <B>--decrypt</B>. Note that
<B>--multifile --verify</B> may not be used with detached signatures.
<P>
<DT id="14"><B>--verify-files</B>

<DD>
Identical to <B>--multifile --verify</B>.
<P>
<DT id="15"><B>--encrypt-files</B>

<DD>
Identical to <B>--multifile --encrypt</B>.
<P>
<DT id="16"><B>--decrypt-files</B>

<DD>
Identical to <B>--multifile --decrypt</B>.
<P>
<DT id="17"><B>--list-keys</B>

<DD>

<B>-k</B>


<B>--list-public-keys</B>

List the specified keys.  If no keys are specified, then all keys from
the configured public keyrings are listed.
<P>
Never use the output of this command in scripts or other programs.
The output is intended only for humans and its format is likely to
change.  The <B>--with-colons</B> option emits the output in a
stable, machine-parseable format, which is intended for use by scripts
and other programs.
<P>
<DT id="18"><B>--list-secret-keys</B>

<DD>

<B>-K</B>

List the specified secret keys.  If no keys are specified, then all
known secret keys are listed.  A <B>#</B> after the initial tags
<B>sec</B> or <B>ssb</B> means that the secret key or subkey is
currently not usable.  We also say that this key has been taken
offline (for example, a primary key can be taken offline by exporting
the key using the command <B>--export-secret-subkeys</B>).  A
<B>&gt;</B> after these tags indicate that the key is stored on a
smartcard.  See also <B>--list-keys</B>.
<P>
<DT id="19"><B>--check-signatures</B>

<DD>

<B>--check-sigs</B>

Same as <B>--list-keys</B>, but the key signatures are verified and
listed too.  Note that for performance reasons the revocation status
of a signing key is not shown.  This command has the same effect as
using <B>--list-keys</B> with <B>--with-sig-check</B>.
<P>
The status of the verification is indicated by a flag directly
following the &quot;sig&quot; tag (and thus before the flags described below.  A
&quot;!&quot; indicates that the signature has been successfully verified, a &quot;-&quot;
denotes a bad signature and a &quot;%&quot; is used if an error occurred while
checking the signature (e.g. a non supported algorithm).  Signatures
where the public key is not available are not listed; to see their
keyids the command <B>--list-sigs</B> can be used.
<P>
For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the
signature status flag and keyid.  These flags give additional
information about each key signature.  From left to right, they are
the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see
<B>--ask-cert-level</B>), &quot;L&quot; for a local or non-exportable
signature (see <B>--lsign-key</B>), &quot;R&quot; for a nonRevocable signature
(see the <B>--edit-key</B> command &quot;nrsign&quot;), &quot;P&quot; for a signature
that contains a policy URL (see <B>--cert-policy-url</B>), &quot;N&quot; for a
signature that contains a notation (see <B>--cert-notation</B>), &quot;X&quot;
for an eXpired signature (see <B>--ask-cert-expire</B>), and the
numbers 1-9 or &quot;T&quot; for 10 and above to indicate trust signature levels
(see the <B>--edit-key</B> command &quot;tsign&quot;).
<P>
<P>
<DT id="20"><B>--locate-keys</B>

<DD>

<B>--locate-external-keys</B>

Locate the keys given as arguments.  This command basically uses the
same algorithm as used when locating keys for encryption or signing
and may thus be used to see what keys <B>gpg</B> might use.
In particular external methods as defined by
<B>--auto-key-locate</B> may be used to locate a key.  Only public
keys are listed.  The variant <B>--locate-external-keys</B> does not
consider a locally existing key and can thus be used to force the
refresh of a key via the defined external methods.
<P>
<DT id="21"><B>--show-keys</B>

<DD>
This commands takes OpenPGP keys as input and prints information about
them in the same way the command <B>--list-keys</B> does for locally
stored key.  In addition the list options <B>show-unusable-uids</B>,
<B>show-unusable-subkeys</B>, <B>show-notations</B> and
<B>show-policy-urls</B> are also enabled.  As usual for automated
processing, this command should be combined with the option
<B>--with-colons</B>.
<P>
<DT id="22"><B>--fingerprint</B>

<DD>
List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their
fingerprints. This is the same output as <B>--list-keys</B> but with
the additional output of a line with the fingerprint. May also be
combined with <B>--check-signatures</B>.  If this
command is given twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys are
listed too.  This command also forces pretty printing of fingerprints
if the keyid format has been set to &quot;none&quot;.
<P>
<DT id="23"><B>--list-packets</B>

<DD>
List only the sequence of packets.  This command is only useful for
debugging.  When used with option <B>--verbose</B> the actual MPI
values are dumped and not only their lengths.  Note that the output of
this command may change with new releases.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="24"><B>--edit-card</B>

<DD>

<B>--card-edit</B>

Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand &quot;help&quot; provides
an overview on available commands. For a detailed description, please
see the Card HOWTO at
<A HREF="https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO">https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO</A> .
<P>
<DT id="25"><B>--card-status</B>

<DD>
Show the content of the smart card.
<P>
<DT id="26"><B>--change-pin</B>

<DD>
Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard. This
functionality is also available as the subcommand &quot;passwd&quot; with the
<B>--edit-card</B> command.
<P>
<DT id="27"><B>--delete-keys </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Remove key from the public keyring. In batch mode either <B>--yes</B> is
required or the key must be specified by fingerprint. This is a
safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys.  If the
exclamation mark syntax is used with the fingerprint of a subkey only
that subkey is deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with the
fingerprint of the primary key the entire public key is deleted.
<P>
<DT id="28"><B>--delete-secret-keys </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Remove key from the secret keyring. In batch mode the key must be
specified by fingerprint.  The option <B>--yes</B> can be used to
advice gpg-agent not to request a confirmation.  This extra
pre-caution is done because <B>gpg</B> can't be sure that the
secret key (as controlled by gpg-agent) is only used for the given
OpenPGP public key.  If the exclamation mark syntax is used with the
fingerprint of a subkey only the secret part of that subkey is
deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the
primary key only the secret part of the primary key is deleted.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="29"><B>--delete-secret-and-public-key </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Same as <B>--delete-key</B>, but if a secret key exists, it will be
removed first. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint.
The option <B>--yes</B> can be used to advice gpg-agent not to
request a confirmation.
<P>
<DT id="30"><B>--export</B>

<DD>
Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and those
registered via option <B>--keyring</B>), or if at least one name is given,
those of the given name. The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the
file given with option <B>--output</B>.  Use together with
<B>--armor</B> to mail those keys.
<P>
<DT id="31"><B>--send-keys </B><I>keyIDs</I>

<DD>
Similar to <B>--export</B> but sends the keys to a keyserver.
Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs.
Don't send your complete keyring to a keyserver --- select
only those keys which are new or changed by you.  If no <I>keyIDs</I>
are given, <B>gpg</B> does nothing.
<P>
<DT id="32"><B>--export-secret-keys</B>

<DD>

<B>--export-secret-subkeys</B>

Same as <B>--export</B>, but exports the secret keys instead.  The
exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option
<B>--output</B>.  This command is often used along with the option
<B>--armor</B> to allow for easy printing of the key for paper backup;
however the external tool <B>paperkey</B> does a better job of
creating backups on paper.  Note that exporting a secret key can be a
security risk if the exported keys are sent over an insecure channel.
<P>
The second form of the command has the special property to render the
secret part of the primary key useless; this is a GNU extension to
OpenPGP and other implementations can not be expected to successfully
import such a key.  Its intended use is in generating a full key with
an additional signing subkey on a dedicated machine.  This command
then exports the key without the primary key to the main machine.
<P>
GnuPG may ask you to enter the passphrase for the key.  This is
required, because the internal protection method of the secret key is
different from the one specified by the OpenPGP protocol.
<P>
<DT id="33"><B>--export-ssh-key</B>

<DD>
This command is used to export a key in the OpenSSH public key format.
It requires the specification of one key by the usual means and
exports the latest valid subkey which has an authentication capability
to STDOUT or to the file given with option <B>--output</B>.  That
output can directly be added to ssh's '<I>authorized_key</I>' file.
<P>
By specifying the key to export using a key ID or a fingerprint
suffixed with an exclamation mark (!), a specific subkey or the
primary key can be exported.  This does not even require that the key
has the authentication capability flag set.
<P>
<DT id="34"><B>--import</B>

<DD>

<B>--fast-import</B>

Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the
keyring. The fast version is currently just a synonym.
<P>
There are a few other options which control how this command works.
Most notable here is the <B>--import-options merge-only</B> option
which does not insert new keys but does only the merging of new
signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.
<P>
<DT id="35"><B>--receive-keys </B><I>keyIDs</I>

<DD>

<B>--recv-keys </B><I>keyIDs</I>

Import the keys with the given <I>keyIDs</I> from a keyserver.
<P>
<DT id="36"><B>--refresh-keys</B>

<DD>
Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the
local keyring. This is useful for updating a key with the latest
signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments will refresh
the entire keyring.
<P>
<DT id="37"><B>--search-keys </B><I>names</I>

<DD>
Search the keyserver for the given <I>names</I>. Multiple names given
here will be joined together to create the search string for the
keyserver.  Note that keyservers search for <I>names</I> in a different
and simpler way than gpg does.  The best choice is to use a mail
address.  Due to data privacy reasons keyservers may even not even
allow searching by user id or mail address and thus may only return
results when being used with the <B>--recv-key</B> command to
search by key fingerprint or keyid.
<P>
<DT id="38"><B>--fetch-keys </B><I>URIs</I>

<DD>
Retrieve keys located at the specified <I>URIs</I>. Note that different
installations of GnuPG may support different protocols (HTTP, FTP,
LDAP, etc.).  When using HTTPS the system provided root certificates
are used by this command.
<P>
<DT id="39"><B>--update-trustdb</B>

<DD>
Do trust database maintenance. This command iterates over all keys and
builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive command because it may
have to ask for the &quot;ownertrust&quot; values for keys. The user has to give
an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the displayed key to
correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust
value if it has not yet been assigned to a key. Using the
<B>--edit-key</B> menu, the assigned value can be changed at any time.
<P>
<DT id="40"><B>--check-trustdb</B>

<DD>
Do trust database maintenance without user interaction. From time to
time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or
signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be
tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do it
automatically unless <B>--no-auto-check-trustdb</B> is set. This
command can be used to force a trust database check at any time. The
processing is identical to that of <B>--update-trustdb</B> but it
skips keys with a not yet defined &quot;ownertrust&quot;.
<P>
For use with cron jobs, this command can be used together with
<B>--batch</B> in which case the trust database check is done only if
a check is needed. To force a run even in batch mode add the option
<B>--yes</B>.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="41"><B>--export-ownertrust</B>

<DD>
Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for backup purposes
as these values are the only ones which can't be re-created from a
corrupted trustdb.  Example:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="42"><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="43"><DD>
<PRE>
  gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; otrust.txt
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<P>
<P>
<DT id="44"><B>--import-ownertrust</B>

<DD>
Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in <B>files</B> (or
STDIN if not given); existing values will be overwritten.  In case of a
severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of the
ownertrust values (e.g. in the file '<I>otrust.txt</I>'), you may re-create
the trustdb using these commands:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="45"><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="46"><DD>
<PRE>
  cd ~/.gnupg
  rm trustdb.gpg
  gpg --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<P>
<P>
<DT id="47"><B>--rebuild-keydb-caches</B>

<DD>
When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be used
to create signature caches in the keyring. It might be handy in other
situations too.
<P>
<DT id="48"><B>--print-md </B><I>algo</I>

<DD>

<B>--print-mds</B>

Print message digest of algorithm <I>algo</I> for all given files or STDIN.
With the second form (or a deprecated &quot;*&quot; for <I>algo</I>) digests for all
available algorithms are printed.

<DT id="49"><B>--gen-random </B><I>0|1|2</I> <I>count</I>

<DD>
Emit <I>count</I> random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If
<I>count</I> is not given or zero, an endless sequence of random bytes
will be emitted.  If used with <B>--armor</B> the output will be
base64 encoded.  PLEASE, don't use this command unless you know what
you are doing; it may remove precious entropy from the system!

<H3>How to manage your keys</H3>

&nbsp;
<P>
This section explains the main commands for key management.
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="53"><B>--quick-generate-key </B><I>user-id</I> [<I>algo</I> [<I>usage</I> [<I>expire</I>]]]

<DD>

<B>--quick-gen-key</B>

This is a simple command to generate a standard key with one user id.
In contrast to <B>--generate-key</B> the key is generated directly
without the need to answer a bunch of prompts.  Unless the option
<B>--yes</B> is given, the key creation will be canceled if the
given user id already exists in the keyring.
<P>
If invoked directly on the console without any special options an
answer to a ``Continue?'' style confirmation prompt is required.  In
case the user id already exists in the keyring a second prompt to
force the creation of the key will show up.
<P>
If <I>algo</I> or <I>usage</I> are given, only the primary key is
created and no prompts are shown.  To specify an expiration date but
still create a primary and subkey use ``default'' or
``future-default'' for <I>algo</I> and ``default'' for <I>usage</I>.
For a description of these optional arguments see the command
<B>--quick-add-key</B>.  The <I>usage</I> accepts also the value
``cert'' which can be used to create a certification only primary key;
the default is to a create certification and signing key.
<P>
The <I>expire</I> argument can be used to specify an expiration date
for the key.  Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO formats
``YYYY-MM-DD'' or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss'' are used.  To make the key
expire in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use
``seconds=N'', ``Nd'', ``Nw'', ``Nm'', or ``Ny'' respectively.  Not
specifying a value, or using ``-'' results in a key expiring in a
reasonable default interval.  The values ``never'', ``none'' can be
used for no expiration date.
<P>
If this command is used with <B>--batch</B>,
<B>--pinentry-mode</B> has been set to <B>loopback</B>, and one of
the passphrase options (<B>--passphrase</B>,
<B>--passphrase-fd</B>, or <B>passphrase-file</B>) is used, the
supplied passphrase is used for the new key and the agent does not ask
for it.  To create a key without any protection <B>--passphrase ''</B>
may be used.
<P>
To create an OpenPGP key from the keys available on the currently
inserted smartcard, the special string ``card'' can be used for
<I>algo</I>.  If the card features an encryption and a signing key, gpg
will figure them out and creates an OpenPGP key consisting of the
usual primary key and one subkey.  This works only with certain
smartcards.  Note that the interactive <B>--full-gen-key</B> command
allows to do the same but with greater flexibility in the selection of
the smartcard keys.
<P>
Note that it is possible to create a primary key and a subkey using
non-default algorithms by using ``default'' and changing the default
parameters using the option <B>--default-new-key-algo</B>.
<P>
<DT id="54"><B>--quick-set-expire </B><I>fpr</I> <I>expire</I> [*|<I>subfprs</I>]

<DD>
With two arguments given, directly set the expiration time of the
primary key identified by <I>fpr</I> to <I>expire</I>.  To remove the
expiration time <B>0</B> can be used.  With three arguments and the
third given as an asterisk, the expiration time of all non-revoked and
not yet expired subkeys are set to <I>expire</I>.  With more than two
arguments and a list of fingerprints given for <I>subfprs</I>, all
non-revoked subkeys matching these fingerprints are set to
<I>expire</I>.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="55"><B>--quick-add-key </B><I>fpr</I> [<I>algo</I> [<I>usage</I> [<I>expire</I>]]]

<DD>
Directly add a subkey to the key identified by the fingerprint
<I>fpr</I>.  Without the optional arguments an encryption subkey is
added.  If any of the arguments are given a more specific subkey is
added.
<P>
<I>algo</I> may be any of the supported algorithms or curve names
given in the format as used by key listings.  To use the default
algorithm the string ``default'' or ``-'' can be used.  Supported
algorithms are ``rsa'', ``dsa'', ``elg'', ``ed25519'', ``cv25519'',
and other ECC curves.  For example the string ``rsa'' adds an RSA key
with the default key length; a string ``rsa4096'' requests that the
key length is 4096 bits.  The string ``future-default'' is an alias
for the algorithm which will likely be used as default algorithm in
future versions of gpg.  To list the supported ECC curves the command
<B>gpg --with-colons --list-config curve</B> can be used.
<P>
Depending on the given <I>algo</I> the subkey may either be an
encryption subkey or a signing subkey.  If an algorithm is capable of
signing and encryption and such a subkey is desired, a <I>usage</I>
string must be given.  This string is either ``default'' or ``-'' to
keep the default or a comma delimited list (or space delimited list)
of keywords: ``sign'' for a signing subkey, ``auth'' for an
authentication subkey, and ``encr'' for an encryption subkey
(``encrypt'' can be used as alias for ``encr'').  The valid
combinations depend on the algorithm.
<P>
The <I>expire</I> argument can be used to specify an expiration date
for the key.  Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO formats
``YYYY-MM-DD'' or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss'' are used.  To make the key
expire in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use
``seconds=N'', ``Nd'', ``Nw'', ``Nm'', or ``Ny'' respectively.  Not
specifying a value, or using ``-'' results in a key expiring in a
reasonable default interval.  The values ``never'', ``none'' can be
used for no expiration date.
<P>
<DT id="56"><B>--generate-key</B>

<DD>

<B>--gen-key</B>

Generate a new key pair using the current default parameters.  This is
the standard command to create a new key.  In addition to the key a
revocation certificate is created and stored in the
'<I>openpgp-revocs.d</I>' directory below the GnuPG home directory.
<P>
<DT id="57"><B>--full-generate-key</B>

<DD>

<B>--full-gen-key</B>

Generate a new key pair with dialogs for all options.  This is an
extended version of <B>--generate-key</B>.
<P>
There is also a feature which allows you to create keys in batch
mode. See the manual section ``Unattended key generation'' on how
to use this.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="58"><B>--generate-revocation </B><I>name</I>

<DD>

<B>--gen-revoke </B><I>name</I>

Generate a revocation certificate for the complete key.  To only revoke
a subkey or a key signature, use the <B>--edit</B> command.
<P>
This command merely creates the revocation certificate so that it can
be used to revoke the key if that is ever needed.  To actually revoke
a key the created revocation certificate needs to be merged with the
key to revoke.  This is done by importing the revocation certificate
using the <B>--import</B> command.  Then the revoked key needs to be
published, which is best done by sending the key to a keyserver
(command <B>--send-key</B>) and by exporting (<B>--export</B>) it
to a file which is then send to frequent communication partners.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="59"><B>--generate-designated-revocation </B><I>name</I>

<DD>

<B>--desig-revoke </B><I>name</I>

Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key. This allows a
user (with the permission of the keyholder) to revoke someone else's
key.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="60"><B>--edit-key</B>

<DD>
Present a menu which enables you to do most of the key management
related tasks.  It expects the specification of a key on the command
line.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="61"><DD>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="62"><B>uid </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Toggle selection of user ID or photographic user ID with index <I>n</I>.
Use <B>*</B> to select all and <B>0</B> to deselect all.
<P>
<DT id="63"><B>key </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Toggle selection of subkey with index <I>n</I> or key ID <I>n</I>.
Use <B>*</B> to select all and <B>0</B> to deselect all.
<P>
<DT id="64"><B>sign</B>

<DD>
Make a signature on key of user <B>name</B>. If the key is not yet
signed by the default user (or the users given with <B>-u</B>), the program
displays the information of the key again, together with its
fingerprint and asks whether it should be signed. This question is
repeated for all users specified with
<B>-u</B>.
<P>
<DT id="65"><B>lsign</B>

<DD>
Same as &quot;sign&quot; but the signature is marked as non-exportable and will
therefore never be used by others. This may be used to make keys
valid only in the local environment.
<P>
<DT id="66"><B>nrsign</B>

<DD>
Same as &quot;sign&quot; but the signature is marked as non-revocable and can
therefore never be revoked.
<P>
<DT id="67"><B>tsign</B>

<DD>
Make a trust signature. This is a signature that combines the notions
of certification (like a regular signature), and trust (like the
&quot;trust&quot; command). It is generally only useful in distinct communities
or groups.  For more information please read the sections
``Trust Signature'' and ``Regular Expression'' in RFC-4880.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="68"><DD>
Note that &quot;l&quot; (for local / non-exportable), &quot;nr&quot; (for non-revocable,
and &quot;t&quot; (for trust) may be freely mixed and prefixed to &quot;sign&quot; to
create a signature of any type desired.
</DL>

<P>
If the option <B>--only-sign-text-ids</B> is specified, then any
non-text based user ids (e.g., photo IDs) will not be selected for
signing.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="69"><DD>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="70"><B>delsig</B>

<DD>
Delete a signature. Note that it is not possible to retract a signature,
once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case
you better use <B>revsig</B>.
<P>
<DT id="71"><B>revsig</B>

<DD>
Revoke a signature. For every signature which has been generated by
one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a revocation certificate
should be generated.
<P>
<DT id="72"><B>check</B>

<DD>
Check the signatures on all selected user IDs.  With the extra
option <B>selfsig</B> only self-signatures are shown.
<P>
<DT id="73"><B>adduid</B>

<DD>
Create an additional user ID.
<P>
<DT id="74"><B>addphoto</B>

<DD>
Create a photographic user ID. This will prompt for a JPEG file that
will be embedded into the user ID. Note that a very large JPEG will make
for a very large key. Also note that some programs will display your
JPEG unchanged (GnuPG), and some programs will scale it to fit in a
dialog box (PGP).
<P>
<DT id="75"><B>showphoto</B>

<DD>
Display the selected photographic user ID.
<P>
<DT id="76"><B>deluid</B>

<DD>
Delete a user ID or photographic user ID.  Note that it is not
possible to retract a user id, once it has been send to the public
(i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use <B>revuid</B>.
<P>
<DT id="77"><B>revuid</B>

<DD>
Revoke a user ID or photographic user ID.
<P>
<DT id="78"><B>primary</B>

<DD>
Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the primary user
id flag from all other user ids and sets the timestamp of all affected
self-signatures one second ahead. Note that setting a photo user ID
as primary makes it primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a
regular user ID as primary makes it primary over other regular user
IDs.
<P>
<DT id="79"><B>keyserver</B>

<DD>
Set a preferred keyserver for the specified user ID(s). This allows
other users to know where you prefer they get your key from. See
<B>--keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url</B> for more on how this
works.  Setting a value of &quot;none&quot; removes an existing preferred
keyserver.
<P>
<DT id="80"><B>notation</B>

<DD>
Set a name=value notation for the specified user ID(s). See
<B>--cert-notation</B> for more on how this works. Setting a value of
&quot;none&quot; removes all notations, setting a notation prefixed with a minus
sign (-) removes that notation, and setting a notation name (without the
=value) prefixed with a minus sign removes all notations with that name.
<P>
<DT id="81"><B>pref</B>

<DD>
List preferences from the selected user ID. This shows the actual
preferences, without including any implied preferences.
<P>
<DT id="82"><B>showpref</B>

<DD>
More verbose preferences listing for the selected user ID. This shows
the preferences in effect by including the implied preferences of 3DES
(cipher), SHA-1 (digest), and Uncompressed (compression) if they are
not already included in the preference list. In addition, the
preferred keyserver and signature notations (if any) are shown.
<P>
<DT id="83"><B>setpref </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Set the list of user ID preferences to <I>string</I> for all (or just
the selected) user IDs. Calling setpref with no arguments sets the
preference list to the default (either built-in or set via
<B>--default-preference-list</B>), and calling setpref with &quot;none&quot;
as the argument sets an empty preference list. Use <B>gpg
--version</B> to get a list of available algorithms. Note that while you
can change the preferences on an attribute user ID (aka &quot;photo ID&quot;),
GnuPG does not select keys via attribute user IDs so these preferences
will not be used by GnuPG.
<P>
When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in the order
which you'd like to see them used by someone else when encrypting a
message to your key.  If you don't include 3DES, it will be
automatically added at the end.  Note that there are many factors that
go into choosing an algorithm (for example, your key may not be the
only recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP application being used to
send to you may or may not follow your exact chosen order for a given
message.  It will, however, only choose an algorithm that is present
on the preference list of every recipient key.  See also the
INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.
<P>
<DT id="84"><B>addkey</B>

<DD>
Add a subkey to this key.
<P>
<DT id="85"><B>addcardkey</B>

<DD>
Generate a subkey on a card and add it to this key.
<P>
<DT id="86"><B>keytocard</B>

<DD>
Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if no subkey
has been selected) to a smartcard. The secret key in the keyring will
be replaced by a stub if the key could be stored successfully on the
card and you use the save command later. Only certain key types may be
transferred to the card. A sub menu allows you to select on what card
to store the key. Note that it is not possible to get that key back
from the card - if the card gets broken your secret key will be lost
unless you have a backup somewhere.
<P>
<DT id="87"><B>bkuptocard </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Restore the given <I>file</I> to a card. This command may be used to restore a
backup key (as generated during card initialization) to a new card. In
almost all cases this will be the encryption key. You should use this
command only with the corresponding public key and make sure that the
file given as argument is indeed the backup to restore. You should then
select 2 to restore as encryption key.  You will first be asked to enter
the passphrase of the backup key and then for the Admin PIN of the card.
<P>
<DT id="88"><B>delkey</B>

<DD>
Remove a subkey (secondary key). Note that it is not possible to retract
a subkey, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In
that case you better use <B>revkey</B>.  Also note that this only
deletes the public part of a key.
<P>
<DT id="89"><B>revkey</B>

<DD>
Revoke a subkey.
<P>
<DT id="90"><B>expire</B>

<DD>
Change the key or subkey expiration time. If a subkey is selected, the
expiration time of this subkey will be changed. With no selection, the
key expiration of the primary key is changed.
<P>
<DT id="91"><B>trust</B>

<DD>
Change the owner trust value for the key. This updates the trust-db
immediately and no save is required.
<P>
<DT id="92"><B>disable</B>

<DD>

<B>enable</B>

Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can not normally be
used for encryption.
<P>
<DT id="93"><B>addrevoker</B>

<DD>
Add a designated revoker to the key. This takes one optional argument:
&quot;sensitive&quot;. If a designated revoker is marked as sensitive, it will
not be exported by default (see export-options).
<P>
<DT id="94"><B>passwd</B>

<DD>
Change the passphrase of the secret key.
<P>
<DT id="95"><B>toggle</B>

<DD>
This is dummy command which exists only for backward compatibility.
<P>
<DT id="96"><B>clean</B>

<DD>
Compact (by removing all signatures except the selfsig) any user ID
that is no longer usable (e.g. revoked, or expired). Then, remove any
signatures that are not usable by the trust calculations.
Specifically, this removes any signature that does not validate, any
signature that is superseded by a later signature, revoked signatures,
and signatures issued by keys that are not present on the keyring.
<P>
<DT id="97"><B>minimize</B>

<DD>
Make the key as small as possible. This removes all signatures from
each user ID except for the most recent self-signature.
<P>
<DT id="98"><B>change-usage</B>

<DD>
Change the usage flags (capabilities) of the primary key or of
subkeys.  These usage flags (e.g. Certify, Sign, Authenticate,
Encrypt) are set during key creation.  Sometimes it is useful to
have the opportunity to change them (for example to add
Authenticate) after they have been created.  Please take care when
doing this; the allowed usage flags depend on the key algorithm.
<P>
<DT id="99"><B>cross-certify</B>

<DD>
Add cross-certification signatures to signing subkeys that may not
currently have them. Cross-certification signatures protect against a
subtle attack against signing subkeys. See
<B>--require-cross-certification</B>.  All new keys generated have
this signature by default, so this command is only useful to bring
older keys up to date.
<P>
<DT id="100"><B>save</B>

<DD>
Save all changes to the keyrings and quit.
<P>
<DT id="101"><B>quit</B>

<DD>
Quit the program without updating the
keyrings.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="102"><DD>
The listing shows you the key with its secondary keys and all user
IDs.  The primary user ID is indicated by a dot, and selected keys or
user IDs are indicated by an asterisk.  The trust
value is displayed with the primary key: &quot;trust&quot; is the assigned owner
trust and &quot;validity&quot; is the calculated validity of the key.  Validity
values are also displayed for all user IDs.
For possible values of trust, see: [trust-values].
</DL>

<P>
<DT id="103"><B>--sign-key </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Signs a public key with your secret key. This is a shortcut version of
the subcommand &quot;sign&quot; from <B>--edit</B>.
<P>
<DT id="104"><B>--lsign-key </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as
non-exportable. This is a shortcut version of the subcommand &quot;lsign&quot;
from <B>--edit-key</B>.
<P>
<DT id="105"><B>--quick-sign-key </B><I>fpr</I> [<I>names</I>]

<DD>

<B>--quick-lsign-key </B><I>fpr</I> [<I>names</I>]

Directly sign a key from the passphrase without any further user
interaction.  The <I>fpr</I> must be the verified primary fingerprint
of a key in the local keyring. If no <I>names</I> are given, all
useful user ids are signed; with given [<I>names</I>] only useful user
ids matching one of theses names are signed.  By default, or if a name
is prefixed with a '*', a case insensitive substring match is used.
If a name is prefixed with a '=' a case sensitive exact match is done.
<P>
The command <B>--quick-lsign-key</B> marks the signatures as
non-exportable.  If such a non-exportable signature already exists the
<B>--quick-sign-key</B> turns it into a exportable signature.
<P>
This command uses reasonable defaults and thus does not provide the
full flexibility of the &quot;sign&quot; subcommand from <B>--edit-key</B>.
Its intended use is to help unattended key signing by utilizing a list
of verified fingerprints.
<P>
<DT id="106"><B>--quick-add-uid  </B><I>user-id</I> <I>new-user-id</I>

<DD>
This command adds a new user id to an existing key.  In contrast to
the interactive sub-command <B>adduid</B> of <B>--edit-key</B> the
<I>new-user-id</I> is added verbatim with only leading and trailing
white space removed, it is expected to be UTF-8 encoded, and no checks
on its form are applied.
<P>
<DT id="107"><B>--quick-revoke-uid  </B><I>user-id</I> <I>user-id-to-revoke</I>

<DD>
This command revokes a user ID on an existing key.  It cannot be used
to revoke the last user ID on key (some non-revoked user ID must
remain), with revocation reason ``User ID is no longer valid''.  If
you want to specify a different revocation reason, or to supply
supplementary revocation text, you should use the interactive
sub-command <B>revuid</B> of <B>--edit-key</B>.
<P>
<DT id="108"><B>--quick-set-primary-uid  </B><I>user-id</I> <I>primary-user-id</I>

<DD>
This command sets or updates the primary user ID flag on an existing
key.  <I>user-id</I> specifies the key and <I>primary-user-id</I> the
user ID which shall be flagged as the primary user ID.  The primary
user ID flag is removed from all other user ids and the timestamp of
all affected self-signatures is set one second ahead.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="109"><B>--change-passphrase </B><I>user-id</I>

<DD>

<B>--passwd </B><I>user-id</I>

Change the passphrase of the secret key belonging to the certificate
specified as <I>user-id</I>.  This is a shortcut for the sub-command
<B>passwd</B> of the edit key menu.  When using together with the
option <B>--dry-run</B> this will not actually change the passphrase
but check that the current passphrase is correct.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<B>gpg</B> features a bunch of options to control the exact
behaviour and to change the default configuration.
<P>
<P>
Long options can be put in an options file (default
&quot;~/.gnupg/gpg.conf&quot;). Short option names will not work - for example,
&quot;armor&quot; is a valid option for the options file, while &quot;a&quot; is not. Do not
write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any required
arguments. Lines with a hash ('#') as the first non-white-space
character are ignored. Commands may be put in this file too, but that is
not generally useful as the command will execute automatically with
every execution of gpg.
<P>
Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non-option is

<DT id="110"><B>--default-key </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Use <I>name</I> as the default key to sign with. If this option is not
used, the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring.
Note that <B>-u</B> or <B>--local-user</B> overrides this option.
This option may be given multiple times.  In this case, the last key
for which a secret key is available is used.  If there is no secret
key available for any of the specified values, GnuPG will not emit an
error message but continue as if this option wasn't given.
<P>
<DT id="111"><B>--default-recipient </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Use <I>name</I> as default recipient if option <B>--recipient</B> is
not used and don't ask if this is a valid one. <I>name</I> must be
non-empty.
<P>
<DT id="112"><B>--default-recipient-self</B>

<B>--no-batch</B>

Use batch mode.  Never ask, do not allow interactive commands.
<B>--no-batch</B> disables this option.  Note that even with a
filename given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from
STDIN (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a
detached signature and no data file has been specified).  Thus if you
do not want to feed data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to
g'<I>/dev/null</I>'.

<P>
<DT id="144"><B>pka-lookups</B>

<DD>
Enable PKA lookups to verify sender addresses. Note that PKA is based
on DNS, and so enabling this option may disclose information on when

<DD>

<B>--disable-large-rsa</B>

With --generate-key and --batch, enable the creation of RSA secret keys as
large as 8192 bit.  Note: 8192 bit is more than is generally
recommended.  These large keys don't significantly improve security,
but they are more expensive to use, and their signatures and
certifications are larger.  This option is only available if the
binary was build with large-secmem support.
<P>
<DT id="147"><B>--enable-dsa2</B>

<DD>

<B>--disable-dsa2</B>

Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys even for old DSA Keys up to
1024 bit.  This is also the default with <B>--openpgp</B>.  Note
that older versions of GnuPG also required this flag to allow the
generation of DSA larger than 1024 bit.
<P>
<DT id="148"><B>--photo-viewer </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
This is the command line that should be run to view a photo ID. &quot;%i&quot;
will be expanded to a filename containing the photo. &quot;%I&quot; does the
same, except the file will not be deleted once the viewer exits.
Other flags are &quot;%k&quot; for the key ID, &quot;%K&quot; for the long key ID, &quot;%f&quot;
for the key fingerprint, &quot;%t&quot; for the extension of the image type
(e.g. &quot;jpg&quot;), &quot;%T&quot; for the MIME type of the image (e.g. &quot;image/jpeg&quot;),
&quot;%v&quot; for the single-character calculated validity of the image being
viewed (e.g. &quot;f&quot;), &quot;%V&quot; for the calculated validity as a string (e.g.
&quot;full&quot;), &quot;%U&quot; for a base32 encoded hash of the user ID,
and &quot;%%&quot; for an actual percent sign. If neither %i or %I are present,
then the photo will be supplied to the viewer on standard input.
<P>
On Unix the default viewer is
<B>xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID 0x%k' STDIN</B>
with a fallback to
<B>display -title 'KeyID 0x%k' %i</B>
and finally to
<B>xdg-open %i</B>.
On Windows
<B>!ShellExecute 400 %i</B> is used; here the command is a meta
command to use that API call followed by a wait time in milliseconds
which is used to give the viewer time to read the temporary image file
before gpg deletes it again.  Note that if your image viewer program
is not secure, then executing it from gpg does not make it secure.

<DT id="150"><B>--keyring </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Add <I>file</I> to the current list of keyrings. If <I>file</I> begins
with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If
the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG
home directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if <B>--homedir</B> or $GNUPGHOME is not
used).
<P>
Note that this adds a keyring to the current list. If the intent is to
use the specified keyring alone, use <B>--keyring</B> along with
<B>--no-default-keyring</B>.
<P>
If the option <B>--no-keyring</B> has been used no keyrings will
be used at all.
<P>

This is an obsolete option and ignored.  All secret keys are stored in
the '<I>private-keys-v1.d</I>' directory below the GnuPG home directory.
<P>
<DT id="152"><B>--primary-keyring </B><I>file</I>

<B>--recv-from</B>) will go to this keyring.
<P>
<DT id="153"><B>--trustdb-name </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Use <I>file</I> instead of the default trustdb. If <I>file</I> begins
with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If
the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG
home directory ('<I>~/.gnupg</I>' if <B>--homedir</B> or $GNUPGHOME is
not used).
<P>
<DT id="154"><B>--homedir </B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Set the name of the home directory to <I>dir</I>. If this option is not
used, the home directory defaults to '<I>~/.gnupg</I>'.  It is only
recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home
directory stated through the environment variable '<I>GNUPGHOME</I>' or
(on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
<I>HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</I>.
<P>
On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
application.  In this case only this command line option is
considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.
<P>
To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create an
empty file named '<I>gpgconf.ctl</I>' in the same directory as the tool
'<I>gpgconf.exe</I>'.  The root of the installation is then that
directory; or, if '<I>gpgconf.exe</I>' has been installed directly below
a directory named '<I>bin</I>', its parent directory.  You also need to
make sure that the following directories exist and are writable:
'<I>ROOT/home</I>' for the GnuPG home and '<I>ROOT/var/cache/gnupg</I>'
for internal cache files.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="155"><B>--display-charset </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Set the name of the native character set. This is used to convert
some informational strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8 encoding.
Note that this has nothing to do with the character set of data to be
encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode user-supplied data. If
this option is not used, the default character set is determined from
the current locale. A verbosity level of 3 shows the chosen set.

<B>--compress-level </B><I>n</I>


<B>--bzip2-compress-level </B><I>n</I>

Set compression level to <I>n</I> for the ZIP and ZLIB compression
algorithms. The default is to use the default compression level of zlib
(normally 6). <B>--bzip2-compress-level</B> sets the compression level
for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This is a
different option from <B>--compress-level</B> since BZIP2 uses a
significant amount of memory for each additional compression level.
<B>-z</B> sets both. A value of 0 for <I>n</I> disables compression.
<P>
<DT id="166"><B>--bzip2-decompress-lowmem</B>

<DD>
Use a different decompression method for BZIP2 compressed files. This
alternate method uses a bit more than half the memory, but also runs
at half the speed. This is useful under extreme low memory
circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a high
<B>--bzip2-compress-level</B>.

<DT id="167"><B>--mangle-dos-filenames</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-mangle-dos-filenames</B>

Older version of Windows cannot handle filenames with more than one
dot. <B>--mangle-dos-filenames</B> causes GnuPG to replace (rather
than add to) the extension of an output filename to avoid this
problem. This option is off by default and has no effect on non-Windows
platforms.
<P>
<DT id="168"><B>--ask-cert-level</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-ask-cert-level</B>

When making a key signature, prompt for a certification level. If this
option is not specified, the certification level used is set via
<B>--default-cert-level</B>. See <B>--default-cert-level</B> for
information on the specific levels and how they are
used. <B>--no-ask-cert-level</B> disables this option. This option
defaults to no.
<P>
<DT id="169"><B>--default-cert-level </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
The default to use for the check level when signing a key.
<P>
0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified
the key.
<P>
1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own
it but you could not, or did not verify the key at all. This is
useful for a &quot;persona&quot; verification, where you sign the key of a
pseudonymous user.
<P>
2 means you did casual verification of the key. For example, this
could mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the
user ID on the key against a photo ID.
<P>
3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For example, this
could mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the
key in person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge
document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key
owner matches the name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you
verified (by exchange of email) that the email address on the key
belongs to the key owner.
<P>
Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just that:
examples. In the end, it is up to you to decide just what &quot;casual&quot;
and &quot;extensive&quot; mean to you.
<P>
This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).
<P>
<DT id="170"><B>--min-cert-level</B>

<DD>
When building the trust database, treat any signatures with a
certification level below this as invalid. Defaults to 2, which
disregards level 1 signatures. Note that level 0 &quot;no particular
claim&quot; signatures are always accepted.
<P>
<DT id="171"><B>--trusted-key </B><I>long key ID</I>

<DD>
Assume that the specified key (which must be given
as a full 8 byte key ID) is as trustworthy as one of
your own secret keys. This option is useful if you
don't want to keep your secret keys (or one of them)
online but still want to be able to check the validity of a given
recipient's or signator's key.

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="174"><B>pgp</B>

<DD>
This is the Web of Trust combined with trust signatures as used in PGP
5.x and later. This is the default trust model when creating a new
trust database.
<P>
<DT id="175"><B>classic</B>

<DD>
This is the standard Web of Trust as introduced by PGP 2.
<P>
<DT id="176"><B>tofu</B>

<DD>
<P>
TOFU stands for Trust On First Use.  In this trust model, the first
time a key is seen, it is memorized.  If later another key with a
user id with the same email address is seen, both keys are marked as
suspect.  In that case, the next time either is used, a warning is
displayed describing the conflict, why it might have occurred
(either the user generated a new key and failed to cross sign the
old and new keys, the key is forgery, or a man-in-the-middle attack
is being attempted), and the user is prompted to manually confirm
the validity of the key in question.
<P>
Because a potential attacker is able to control the email address
and thereby circumvent the conflict detection algorithm by using an
email address that is similar in appearance to a trusted email
address, whenever a message is verified, statistics about the number
of messages signed with the key are shown.  In this way, a user can
easily identify attacks using fake keys for regular correspondents.
<P>
When compared with the Web of Trust, TOFU offers significantly
weaker security guarantees.  In particular, TOFU only helps ensure
consistency (that is, that the binding between a key and email
address doesn't change).  A major advantage of TOFU is that it
requires little maintenance to use correctly.  To use the web of
trust properly, you need to actively sign keys and mark users as
trusted introducers.  This is a time-consuming process and anecdotal
evidence suggests that even security-conscious users rarely take the
time to do this thoroughly and instead rely on an ad-hoc TOFU
process.
<P>
In the TOFU model, policies are associated with bindings between
keys and email addresses (which are extracted from user ids and
normalized).  There are five policies, which can be set manually
using the <B>--tofu-policy</B> option.  The default policy can be
set using the <B>--tofu-default-policy</B> option.
<P>
The TOFU policies are: <B>auto</B>, <B>good</B>, <B>unknown</B>,
<B>bad</B> and <B>ask</B>.  The <B>auto</B> policy is used by
default (unless overridden by <B>--tofu-default-policy</B>) and
marks a binding as marginally trusted.  The <B>good</B>,
<B>unknown</B> and <B>bad</B> policies mark a binding as fully
trusted, as having unknown trust or as having trust never,
respectively.  The <B>unknown</B> policy is useful for just using
TOFU to detect conflicts, but to never assign positive trust to a
binding.  The final policy, <B>ask</B> prompts the user to indicate
the binding's trust.  If batch mode is enabled (or input is
inappropriate in the context), then the user is not prompted and the
<B>undefined</B> trust level is returned.
<P>
<DT id="177"><B>tofu+pgp</B>

<DD>
This trust model combines TOFU with the Web of Trust.  This is done
by computing the trust level for each model and then taking the
maximum trust level where the trust levels are ordered as follows:
<B>unknown &lt; undefined &lt; marginal &lt; fully &lt; ultimate &lt; expired &lt;
never</B>.
<P>
By setting <B>--tofu-default-policy=unknown</B>, this model can be
used to implement the web of trust with TOFU's conflict detection
algorithm, but without its assignment of positive trust values,
which some security-conscious users don't like.
<P>
<DT id="178"><B>direct</B>

<DD>
Key validity is set directly by the user and not calculated via the
Web of Trust.  This model is solely based on the key and does
not distinguish user IDs.  Note that when changing to another trust
model the trust values assigned to a key are transformed into
ownertrust values, which also indicate how you trust the owner of
the key to sign other keys.
<P>
<DT id="179"><B>always</B>

<DD>
Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully
valid. You generally won't use this unless you are using some
external validation scheme. This option also suppresses the
&quot;[uncertain]&quot; tag printed with signature checks when there is no
evidence that the user ID is bound to the key.  Note that this
trust model still does not allow the use of expired, revoked, or
disabled keys.
<P>
<DT id="180"><B>auto</B>

<DD>
Select the trust model depending on whatever the internal trust
database says. This is the default model if such a database already
exists.  Note that a tofu trust model is not considered here and
must be enabled explicitly.

<P>
<DT id="190"><B>local</B>

<DD>
Locate the key using the local keyrings.  This mechanism allows the user to
select the order a local key lookup is done.  Thus using
'--auto-key-locate local' is identical to
<B>--no-auto-key-locate</B>.
<P>
<DT id="191"><B>nodefault</B>

<DD>
This flag disables the standard local key lookup, done before any of the
mechanisms defined by the <B>--auto-key-locate</B> are tried.  The
position of this mechanism in the list does not matter.  It is not
required if <B>local</B> is also used.
<P>
<DT id="192"><B>clear</B>

<DD>
Clear all defined mechanisms.  This is useful to override
mechanisms given in a config file.  Note that a <B>nodefault</B> in
<I>mechanisms</I> will also be cleared unless it is given after the
<B>clear</B>.

<P>
<DT id="193"><B>--auto-key-retrieve</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-auto-key-retrieve</B>

These options enable or disable the automatic retrieving of keys from
a keyserver when verifying signatures made by keys that are not on the
local keyring.  The default is <B>--no-auto-key-retrieve</B>.
<P>
The order of methods tried to lookup the key is:
<P>
1. If a preferred keyserver is specified in the signature and the
option <B>honor-keyserver-url</B> is active (which is not the
default), that keyserver is tried.  Note that the creator of the
signature uses the option <B>--sig-keyserver-url</B> to specify the
preferred keyserver for data signatures.
<P>
2. If the signature has the Signer's UID set (e.g. using
<B>--sender</B> while creating the signature) a Web Key Directory
(WKD) lookup is done.  This is the default configuration but can be
disabled by removing WKD from the auto-key-locate list or by using the
option <B>--disable-signer-uid</B>.
<P>
3. If the option <B>honor-pka-record</B> is active, the legacy PKA
method is used.
<P>
4. If any keyserver is configured and the Issuer Fingerprint is part
of the signature (since GnuPG 2.1.16), the configured keyservers are
tried.
<P>
Note that this option makes a &quot;web bug&quot; like behavior possible.
Keyserver or Web Key Directory operators can see which keys you
request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand new key (which
you naturally will not have on your local keyring), the operator can
tell both your IP address and the time when you verified the
signature.
<P>
<DT id="194"><B>--keyid-format {none|short|0xshort|long|0xlong}</B>

<DD>
Select how to display key IDs.  &quot;none&quot; does not show the key ID at all
but shows the fingerprint in a separate line.  &quot;short&quot; is the
traditional 8-character key ID.  &quot;long&quot; is the more accurate (but less
convenient) 16-character key ID.  Add an &quot;0x&quot; to either to include an
&quot;0x&quot; at the beginning of the key ID, as in 0x99242560.  Note that this
option is ignored if the option <B>--with-colons</B> is used.
<P>
<DT id="195"><B>--keyserver </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
This option is deprecated - please use the <B>--keyserver</B> in
'<I>dirmngr.conf</I>' instead.
<P>
Use <I>name</I> as your keyserver. This is the server that
<B>--receive-keys</B>, <B>--send-keys</B>, and <B>--search-keys</B>
will communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for
keys on. The format of the <I>name</I> is a URI:
`scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]' The scheme is the type of keyserver:
&quot;hkp&quot; for the HTTP (or compatible) keyservers, &quot;ldap&quot; for the LDAP
keyservers, or &quot;mailto&quot; for the Graff email keyserver. Note that your
particular installation of GnuPG may have other keyserver types
available as well. Keyserver schemes are case-insensitive. After the
keyserver name, optional keyserver configuration options may be
provided. These are the same as the global <B>--keyserver-options</B>
from below, but apply only to this particular keyserver.
<P>
Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no
need to send keys to more than one server. The keyserver
<B><A HREF="hkp://keys.gnupg.net">hkp://keys.gnupg.net</A></B> uses round robin DNS to give a different
keyserver each time you use it.
<P>
<DT id="196"><B>--keyserver-options {</B><I>name</I>=<I>value</I>}

<DD>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for the
keyserver. Options can be prefixed with a `no-' to give the opposite
meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may be used here as
well to apply to importing (<B>--recv-key</B>) or exporting
(<B>--send-key</B>) a key from a keyserver. While not all options
are available for all keyserver types, some common options are:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="197"><DD>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="198"><B>include-revoked</B>

<DD>
When searching for a key with <B>--search-keys</B>, include keys that
are marked on the keyserver as revoked. Note that not all keyservers
differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such
keyservers this option is meaningless. Note also that most keyservers do
not have cryptographic verification of key revocations, and so turning
this option off may result in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked
as revoked.
<P>
<DT id="199"><B>include-disabled</B>

<DD>
When searching for a key with <B>--search-keys</B>, include keys that
are marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that this option is not
used with HKP keyservers.
<P>
<DT id="200"><B>auto-key-retrieve</B>

<DD>
This is an obsolete alias for the option <B>auto-key-retrieve</B>.
Please do not use it; it will be removed in future versions..
<P>
<DT id="201"><B>honor-keyserver-url</B>

<DD>
When using <B>--refresh-keys</B>, if the key in question has a preferred
keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to refresh the key
from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature
being verified has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred
keyserver to fetch the key from. Note that this option introduces a
&quot;web bug&quot;: The creator of the key can see when the keys is
refreshed.  Thus this option is not enabled by default.
<P>
<DT id="202"><B>honor-pka-record</B>

<DD>
If <B>--auto-key-retrieve</B> is used, and the signature being
verified has a PKA record, then use the PKA information to fetch
the key. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
<P>
<DT id="203"><B>include-subkeys</B>

<DD>
When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets. Note that
this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as they do not support
retrieving keys by subkey id.
<P>
<DT id="204"><B>timeout</B>

<P>
<P>
<DT id="206"><B>--completes-needed </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Number of completely trusted users to introduce a new

<P>
<DT id="207"><B>--marginals-needed </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Number of marginally trusted users to introduce a new
key signer (defaults to 3)
<P>
<DT id="208"><B>--tofu-default-policy {auto|good|unknown|bad|ask}</B>

<DD>
The default TOFU policy (defaults to <B>auto</B>).  For more
information about the meaning of this option, see: [trust-model-tofu].
<P>
<DT id="209"><B>--max-cert-depth </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5).
<P>
<DT id="210"><B>--no-sig-cache</B>

<DD>
Do not cache the verification status of key signatures.
Caching gives a much better performance in key listings. However, if
you suspect that your public keyring is not safe against write
modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching. It
probably does not make sense to disable it because all kind of damage
can be done if someone else has write access to your public keyring.
<P>
<DT id="211"><B>--auto-check-trustdb</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-auto-check-trustdb</B>

If GnuPG feels that its information about the Web of Trust has to be
updated, it automatically runs the <B>--check-trustdb</B> command
internally.  This may be a time consuming
process. <B>--no-auto-check-trustdb</B> disables this option.
<P>
<DT id="212"><B>--use-agent</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-use-agent</B>

This is dummy option. <B>gpg</B> always requires the agent.
<P>
<DT id="213"><B>--gpg-agent-info</B>

<DD>
This is dummy option. It has no effect when used with <B>gpg</B>.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="214"><B>--agent-program </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Specify an agent program to be used for secret key operations.  The
default value is determined by running <B>gpgconf</B> with the
option <B>--list-dirs</B>.  Note that the pipe symbol (<B>|</B>) is
used for a regression test suite hack and may thus not be used in the
file name.
<P>
<DT id="215"><B>--dirmngr-program </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Specify a dirmngr program to be used for keyserver access.  The
default value is '<I>/usr/bin/dirmngr</I>'.
<P>
<DT id="216"><B>--disable-dirmngr</B>

<DD>
Entirely disable the use of the Dirmngr.
<P>
<DT id="217"><B>--no-autostart</B>

<DD>
Do not start the gpg-agent or the dirmngr if it has not yet been
started and its service is required.  This option is mostly useful on
machines where the connection to gpg-agent has been redirected to
another machines.  If dirmngr is required on the remote machine, it
may be started manually using <B>gpgconf --launch dirmngr</B>.
<P>
<DT id="218"><B>--lock-once</B>

<DD>
Lock the databases the first time a lock is requested
and do not release the lock until the process
terminates.
<P>
<DT id="219"><B>--lock-multiple</B>

<DD>
Release the locks every time a lock is no longer
needed. Use this to override a previous <B>--lock-once</B>
from a config file.
<P>
<DT id="220"><B>--lock-never</B>

<DD>
Disable locking entirely. This option should be used only in very
special environments, where it can be assured that only one process
is accessing those files. A bootable floppy with a stand-alone
encryption system will probably use this. Improper usage of this
option may lead to data and key corruption.
<P>
<DT id="221"><B>--exit-on-status-write-error</B>

<DD>
This option will cause write errors on the status FD to immediately
terminate the process. That should in fact be the default but it never
worked this way and thus we need an option to enable this, so that the
change won't break applications which close their end of a status fd
connected pipe too early. Using this option along with
<B>--enable-progress-filter</B> may be used to cleanly cancel long
running gpg operations.
<P>
<DT id="222"><B>--limit-card-insert-tries </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
With <I>n</I> greater than 0 the number of prompts asking to insert a
smartcard gets limited to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg won't at
all ask to insert a card if none has been inserted at startup. This
option is useful in the configuration file in case an application does
not know about the smartcard support and waits ad infinitum for an
inserted card.
<P>
<DT id="223"><B>--no-random-seed-file</B>

<DD>
GnuPG uses a file to store its internal random pool over invocations.
This makes random generation faster; however sometimes write operations
are not desired. This option can be used to achieve that with the cost of
slower random generation.
<P>
<DT id="224"><B>--no-greeting</B>

<DD>
Suppress the initial copyright message.
<P>
<DT id="225"><B>--no-secmem-warning</B>

<DD>
Suppress the warning about &quot;using insecure memory&quot;.
<P>
<DT id="226"><B>--no-permission-warning</B>

<DD>
Suppress the warning about unsafe file and home directory (<B>--homedir</B>)
permissions. Note that the permission checks that GnuPG performs are
not intended to be authoritative, but rather they simply warn about
certain common permission problems. Do not assume that the lack of a
warning means that your system is secure.
<P>
Note that the warning for unsafe <B>--homedir</B> permissions cannot be
suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an attacker to
place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use this file to suppress
warnings about itself. The <B>--homedir</B> permissions warning may only be
suppressed on the command line.
<P>
<DT id="227"><B>--require-secmem</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-require-secmem</B>

Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get secure memory. Defaults to no
(i.e. run, but give a warning).
<P>
<P>
<DT id="228"><B>--require-cross-certification</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-require-cross-certification</B>

When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross
certification &quot;back signature&quot; on the subkey is present and valid.  This
protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign.
Defaults to <B>--require-cross-certification</B> for
<B>gpg</B>.
<P>
<DT id="229"><B>--expert</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-expert</B>

Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or &quot;silly&quot; things like
signing an expired or revoked key, or certain potentially incompatible
things like generating unusual key types. This also disables certain
warning messages about potentially incompatible actions. As the name
implies, this option is for experts only. If you don't fully
understand the implications of what it allows you to do, leave this
off. <B>--no-expert</B> disables this option.

<DD>

<B>-r</B>

Encrypt for user id <I>name</I>. If this option or
<B>--hidden-recipient</B> is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user-id
unless <B>--default-recipient</B> is given.
<P>
<DT id="231"><B>--hidden-recipient </B><I>name</I>

<DD>

<B>-R</B>

Encrypt for user ID <I>name</I>, but hide the key ID of this user's
key. This option helps to hide the receiver of the message and is a
limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. If this option or
<B>--recipient</B> is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user ID unless
<B>--default-recipient</B> is given.
<P>
<DT id="232"><B>--recipient-file </B><I>file</I>

<DD>

<B>-f</B>

This option is similar to <B>--recipient</B> except that it
encrypts to a key stored in the given file.  <I>file</I> must be the
name of a file containing exactly one key.  <B>gpg</B> assumes that
the key in this file is fully valid.
<P>
<DT id="233"><B>--hidden-recipient-file </B><I>file</I>

<DD>

<B>-F</B>

This option is similar to <B>--hidden-recipient</B> except that it
encrypts to a key stored in the given file.  <I>file</I> must be the
name of a file containing exactly one key.  <B>gpg</B> assumes that
the key in this file is fully valid.
<P>
<DT id="234"><B>--encrypt-to </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Same as <B>--recipient</B> but this one is intended for use in the
options file and may be used with your own user-id as an
&quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;. These keys are only used when there are other
recipients given either by use of <B>--recipient</B> or by the asked
user id.  No trust checking is performed for these user ids and even
disabled keys can be used.
<P>
<DT id="235"><B>--hidden-encrypt-to </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Same as <B>--hidden-recipient</B> but this one is intended for use in the
options file and may be used with your own user-id as a hidden
&quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;. These keys are only used when there are other
recipients given either by use of <B>--recipient</B> or by the asked user id.
No trust checking is performed for these user ids and even disabled
keys can be used.
<P>
<DT id="236"><B>--no-encrypt-to</B>

<DD>
Disable the use of all <B>--encrypt-to</B> and
<B>--hidden-encrypt-to</B> keys.
<P>
<DT id="237"><B>--group {</B><I>name</I>=<I>value</I>}

<DD>
Sets up a named group, which is similar to aliases in email programs.
Any time the group name is a recipient (<B>-r</B> or
<B>--recipient</B>), it will be expanded to the values
specified. Multiple groups with the same name are automatically merged
into a single group.
<P>
The values are <B>key IDs</B> or fingerprints, but any key description
is accepted. Note that a value with spaces in it will be treated as
two different values. Note also there is only one level of expansion
--- you cannot make an group that points to another group. When used
from the command line, it may be necessary to quote the argument to
this option to prevent the shell from treating it as multiple
arguments.
<P>
<DT id="238"><B>--ungroup </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Remove a given entry from the <B>--group</B> list.
<P>
<DT id="239"><B>--no-groups</B>

<DD>
Remove all entries from the <B>--group</B> list.
<P>
<DT id="240"><B>--local-user </B><I>name</I>

<DD>

<B>-u</B>

Use <I>name</I> as the key to sign with. Note that this option overrides
<B>--default-key</B>.
<P>
<DT id="241"><B>--sender </B><I>mbox</I>

<DD>
This option has two purposes.  <I>mbox</I> must either be a complete
user id with a proper mail address or just a mail address.  When
creating a signature this option tells gpg the user id of a key used
to make a signature if the key was not directly specified by a user
id.  When verifying a signature the <I>mbox</I> is used to restrict the
information printed by the TOFU code to matching user ids.
<P>
<DT id="242"><B>--try-secret-key </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
For hidden recipients GPG needs to know the keys to use for trial
decryption.  The key set with <B>--default-key</B> is always tried
first, but this is often not sufficient.  This option allows setting more
keys to be used for trial decryption.  Although any valid user-id
specification may be used for <I>name</I> it makes sense to use at least
the long keyid to avoid ambiguities.  Note that gpg-agent might pop up a
pinentry for a lot keys to do the trial decryption.  If you want to stop
all further trial decryption you may use close-window button instead of
the cancel button.
<P>
<DT id="243"><B>--try-all-secrets</B>

<DD>
Don't look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all secret
keys in turn to find the right decryption key. This option forces the
behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (created by using
<B>--throw-keyids</B> or <B>--hidden-recipient</B>) and might come
handy in case where an encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.
<P>
<DT id="244"><B>--skip-hidden-recipients</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-skip-hidden-recipients</B>

During decryption skip all anonymous recipients.  This option helps in
the case that people use the hidden recipients feature to hide their
own encrypt-to key from others.  If one has many secret keys this
may lead to a major annoyance because all keys are tried in turn to
decrypt something which was not really intended for it.  The drawback
of this option is that it is currently not possible to decrypt a
message which includes real anonymous recipients.

<P>
<DT id="248"><B>--max-output </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be generated
when processing a file. Since OpenPGP supports various levels of
compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a given message may be
significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message. While GnuPG
works properly with such messages, there is often a desire to set a
maximum file size that will be generated before processing is forced to
stop by the OS limits. Defaults to 0, which means &quot;no limit&quot;.
<P>
<DT id="249"><B>--input-size-hint </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
This option can be used to tell GPG the size of the input data in
bytes.  <I>n</I> must be a positive base-10 number.  This option is
only useful if the input is not taken from a file.  GPG may use this
hint to optimize its buffer allocation strategy.  It is also used by
the <B>--status-fd</B> line ``PROGRESS'' to provide a value for
``total'' if that is not available by other means.

gpg can track the origin of a key. Certain origins are implicitly

import the origin of the keys imported can be set with this option.
To list the possible values use &quot;help&quot; for <I>string</I>.  Some origins

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="253"><B>import-local-sigs</B>

Allow importing key signatures marked as &quot;local&quot;. This is not
generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being used.
Defaults to no.
<P>
<DT id="254"><B>keep-ownertrust</B>

<DD>
Normally possible still existing ownertrust values of a key are
cleared if a key is imported.  This is in general desirable so that
a formerly deleted key does not automatically gain an ownertrust
values merely due to import.  On the other hand it is sometimes
necessary to re-import a trusted set of keys again but keeping
already assigned ownertrust values.  This can be achieved by using
this option.
<P>
<DT id="255"><B>repair-pks-subkey-bug</B>

<DD>
During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the PKS keyserver
bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple subkeys. Note
that this cannot completely repair the damaged key as some crucial data
is removed by the keyserver, but it does at least give you back one
subkey. Defaults to no for regular <B>--import</B> and to yes for
keyserver <B>--receive-keys</B>.
<P>
<DT id="256"><B>import-show</B>

<DD>

<B>show-only</B>

Show a listing of the key as imported right before it is stored.
This can be combined with the option <B>--dry-run</B> to only look
at keys; the option <B>show-only</B> is a shortcut for this
combination.  The command <B>--show-keys</B> is another shortcut
for this.  Note that suffixes like '#' for &quot;sec&quot; and &quot;sbb&quot; lines
may or may not be printed.
<P>
<DT id="257"><B>import-export</B>

<DD>
Run the entire import code but instead of storing the key to the

<B>export-pka</B> and <B>export-dane</B> affect the output.  This
option can be used to remove all invalid parts from a key without the

<DT id="259"><B>import-clean</B>

<DD>
After import, compact (remove all signatures except the
self-signature) any user IDs from the new key that are not usable.
Then, remove any signatures from the new key that are not usable.
This includes signatures that were issued by keys that are not present
on the keyring. This option is the same as running the <B>--edit-key</B>
command &quot;clean&quot; after import. Defaults to no.
<P>
<DT id="260"><B>self-sigs-only</B>

<DD>
Accept only self-signatures while importing a key.  All other key
signatures are skipped at an early import stage.  This option can be
used with <B>keyserver-options</B> to mitigate attempts to flood a
key with bogus signatures from a keyserver.  The drawback is that
all other valid key signatures, as required by the Web of Trust are
also not imported.  Note that when using this option along with
import-clean it suppresses the final clean step after merging the
imported key into the existing key.
<P>
<DT id="261"><B>repair-keys</B>

<DD>
After import, fix various problems with the
keys.  For example, this reorders signatures, and strips duplicate
signatures.  Defaults to yes.
<P>
<DT id="262"><B>import-minimal</B>

<DD>
Import the smallest key possible. This removes all signatures except
the most recent self-signature on each user ID. This option is the
same as running the <B>--edit-key</B> command &quot;minimize&quot; after import.
Defaults to no.
<P>
<DT id="263"><B>restore</B>

<DD>

<B>import-restore</B>

Import in key restore mode.  This imports all data which is usually
skipped during import; including all GnuPG specific data.  All other
contradicting options are overridden.

<DT id="264"><B>--import-filter {</B><I>name</I>=<I>expr</I>}

<DD>

<B>--export-filter {</B><I>name</I>=<I>expr</I>}

These options define an import/export filter which are applied to the
imported/exported keyblock right before it will be stored/written.
<I>name</I> defines the type of filter to use, <I>expr</I> the
expression to evaluate.  The option can be used several times which
then appends more expression to the same <I>name</I>.

opposite meaning.  The options are:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="284"><DD>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="285"><B>export-local-sigs</B>

<DD>
Allow exporting key signatures marked as &quot;local&quot;. This is not
generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being used.
Defaults to no.
<P>
<DT id="286"><B>export-attributes</B>

<DD>
Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs) while exporting. Not
including attribute user IDs is useful to export keys that are going
to be used by an OpenPGP program that does not accept attribute user
IDs.  Defaults to yes.
<P>
<DT id="287"><B>export-sensitive-revkeys</B>

<DD>
Include designated revoker information that was marked as
&quot;sensitive&quot;. Defaults to no.
<P>
<P>
<DT id="288"><B>backup</B>

<DD>

<B>export-backup</B>

Export for use as a backup.  The exported data includes all data
which is needed to restore the key or keys later with GnuPG.  The
format is basically the OpenPGP format but enhanced with GnuPG
specific data.  All other contradicting options are overridden.
<P>
<DT id="289"><B>export-clean</B>

<DD>
Compact (remove all signatures from) user IDs on the key being
exported if the user IDs are not usable. Also, do not export any
signatures that are not usable. This includes signatures that were
issued by keys that are not present on the keyring. This option is
the same as running the <B>--edit-key</B> command &quot;clean&quot; before export
except that the local copy of the key is not modified. Defaults to
no.
<P>
<DT id="290"><B>export-minimal</B>

<DD>
Export the smallest key possible. This removes all signatures except the
most recent self-signature on each user ID. This option is the same as
running the <B>--edit-key</B> command &quot;minimize&quot; before export except
that the local copy of the key is not modified. Defaults to no.
<P>
<DT id="291"><B>export-pka</B>

<DD>
Instead of outputting the key material output PKA records suitable
to put into DNS zone files.  An ORIGIN line is printed before each
record to allow diverting the records to the corresponding zone file.
<P>
<DT id="292"><B>export-dane</B>

<DD>
Instead of outputting the key material output OpenPGP DANE records
suitable to put into DNS zone files.  An ORIGIN line is printed before
each record to allow diverting the records to the corresponding zone
file.
<P>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<DT id="293"><B>--with-colons</B>

<DD>
Print key listings delimited by colons. Note that the output will be
encoded in UTF-8 regardless of any <B>--display-charset</B> setting. This
format is useful when GnuPG is called from scripts and other programs
as it is easily machine parsed. The details of this format are
documented in the file '<I>doc/DETAILS</I>', which is included in the GnuPG
source distribution.
<P>
<DT id="294"><B>--fixed-list-mode</B>

<DD>
Do not merge primary user ID and primary key in <B>--with-colon</B>
listing mode and print all timestamps as seconds since 1970-01-01.
Since GnuPG 2.0.10, this mode is always used and thus this option is
obsolete; it does not harm to use it though.
<P>
<DT id="295"><B>--legacy-list-mode</B>

<DD>
Revert to the pre-2.1 public key list mode.  This only affects the
human readable output and not the machine interface
(i.e. <B>--with-colons</B>).  Note that the legacy format does not
convey suitable information for elliptic curves.
<P>
<DT id="296"><B>--with-fingerprint</B>

<DD>
Same as the command <B>--fingerprint</B> but changes only the format
of the output and may be used together with another command.
<P>
<DT id="297"><B>--with-subkey-fingerprint</B>

<DD>
If a fingerprint is printed for the primary key, this option forces
printing of the fingerprint for all subkeys.  This could also be
achieved by using the <B>--with-fingerprint</B> twice but by using
this option along with keyid-format &quot;none&quot; a compact fingerprint is
printed.
<P>
<DT id="298"><B>--with-icao-spelling</B>

<DD>
Print the ICAO spelling of the fingerprint in addition to the hex digits.
<P>
<DT id="299"><B>--with-keygrip</B>

<DD>
Include the keygrip in the key listings.  In <B>--with-colons</B> mode
this is implicitly enable for secret keys.
<P>
<DT id="300"><B>--with-key-origin</B>

<DD>
Include the locally held information on the origin and last update of
a key in a key listing.  In <B>--with-colons</B> mode this is always
printed.  This data is currently experimental and shall not be
considered part of the stable API.
<P>
<DT id="301"><B>--with-wkd-hash</B>

<DD>
Print a Web Key Directory identifier along with each user ID in key
listings.  This is an experimental feature and semantics may change.

<DD>

<B>--no-textmode</B>

Treat input files as text and store them in the OpenPGP canonical text
form with standard &quot;CRLF&quot; line endings. This also sets the necessary
flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or signed data is text
and may need its line endings converted back to whatever the local

message is exceptionally required, the option <B>--rfc2440</B>
allows for this.
<P>
<DT id="307"><B>--disable-signer-uid</B>

<DD>
By default the user ID of the signing key is embedded in the data signature.
As of now this is only done if the signing key has been specified with
<B>local-user</B> using a mail address, or with <B>sender</B>.  This
information can be helpful for verifier to locate the key; see option
<B>--auto-key-retrieve</B>.

<DT id="308"><B>--personal-cipher-preferences </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Set the list of personal cipher preferences to <I>string</I>.  Use

and use <B>none</B> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user
to safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key
preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by
all recipients.  The most highly ranked cipher in this list is also
used for the <B>--symmetric</B> encryption command.
<P>
<DT id="309"><B>--personal-digest-preferences </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Set the list of personal digest preferences to <I>string</I>.  Use
<B>gpg --version</B> to get a list of available algorithms,
and use <B>none</B> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user
to safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key
preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by
all recipients.  The most highly ranked digest algorithm in this list
is also used when signing without encryption
(e.g. <B>--clear-sign</B> or <B>--sign</B>).
<P>
<DT id="310"><B>--personal-compress-preferences </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Set the list of personal compression preferences to <I>string</I>.
Use <B>gpg --version</B> to get a list of available
algorithms, and use <B>none</B> to set no preference at all.  This
allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the
recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that
is usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked compression
algorithm in this list is also used when there are no recipient keys
to consider (e.g. <B>--symmetric</B>).
<P>
<DT id="311"><B>--s2k-cipher-algo </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Use <I>name</I> as the cipher algorithm for symmetric encryption with
a passphrase if <B>--personal-cipher-preferences</B> and
<B>--cipher-algo</B> are not given.  The default is AES-128.
<P>
<DT id="312"><B>--s2k-digest-algo </B><I>name</I>

Use <I>name</I> as the digest algorithm used to mangle the passphrases
for symmetric encryption.  The default is SHA-1.
<P>
<DT id="313"><B>--s2k-mode </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Selects how passphrases for symmetric encryption are mangled. If
<I>n</I> is 0 a plain passphrase (which is in general not recommended)
will be used, a 1 adds a salt (which should not be used) to the
passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a number
of times (see <B>--s2k-count</B>).
<P>
<DT id="314"><B>--s2k-count </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Specify how many times the passphrases mangling for symmetric
encryption is repeated.  This value may range between 1024 and
65011712 inclusive.  The default is inquired from gpg-agent.  Note
that not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an
illegal value is selected, GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal
value.  This option is only meaningful if <B>--s2k-mode</B> is set

OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below before using one of these
options.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="315"><B>--gnupg</B>

<DD>
Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially OpenPGP behavior
(see <B>--openpgp</B>), but with some additional workarounds for common
compatibility problems in different versions of PGP. This is the
default option, so it is not generally needed, but it may be useful to
override a different compliance option in the gpg.conf file.
<P>
<DT id="316"><B>--openpgp</B>

<DD>
Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict OpenPGP
behavior. Use this option to reset all previous options like

<B>--compress-algo</B> to OpenPGP compliant values. All PGP
workarounds are disabled.

behavior. Note that this is currently the same thing as
<B>--openpgp</B>.
<P>
<DT id="318"><B>--rfc4880bis</B>

<DD>
Enable experimental features from proposed updates to RFC-4880.  This

Warning: The behavior may change with any GnuPG release and created
keys or data may not be usable with future GnuPG versions.
<P>
<DT id="319"><B>--rfc2440</B>

<DD>
Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-2440
behavior.  Note that by using this option encryption packets are
created in a legacy mode without MDC protection.  This is dangerous
and should thus only be used for experiments.  See also option
<B>--ignore-mdc-error</B>.
<P>
<DT id="320"><B>--pgp6</B>

<DD>
Set up all options to be as PGP 6 compliant as possible. This
restricts you to the ciphers IDEA (if the IDEA plugin is installed),
3DES, and CAST5, the hashes MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160, and the
compression algorithms none and ZIP. This also disables
<B>--throw-keyids</B>, and making signatures with signing subkeys as PGP 6
does not understand signatures made by signing subkeys.
<P>
This option implies <B>--escape-from-lines</B>.
<P>
<DT id="321"><B>--pgp7</B>

<DD>
Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as possible. This is
identical to <B>--pgp6</B> except that MDCs are not disabled, and the
list of allowable ciphers is expanded to add AES128, AES192, AES256, and
TWOFISH.
<P>
<DT id="322"><B>--pgp8</B>

<DD>
Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as possible. PGP 8 is a lot
closer to the OpenPGP standard than previous versions of PGP, so all
this does is disable <B>--throw-keyids</B> and set
<B>--escape-from-lines</B>.  All algorithms are allowed except for the
SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512 digests.
<P>
<DT id="323"><B>--compliance </B><I>string</I>

check. <I>value</I> may be any printable string; it will be encoded in
UTF-8, so you should check that your <B>--display-charset</B> is set
correctly. If you prefix <I>name</I> with an exclamation mark (!), the

(certifications). <B>--set-notation</B> sets both.
<P>
There are special codes that may be used in notation names. &quot;%k&quot; will
be expanded into the key ID of the key being signed, &quot;%K&quot; into the
long key ID of the key being signed, &quot;%f&quot; into the fingerprint of the
key being signed, &quot;%s&quot; into the key ID of the key making the
signature, &quot;%S&quot; into the long key ID of the key making the signature,
&quot;%g&quot; into the fingerprint of the key making the signature (which might
be a subkey), &quot;%p&quot; into the fingerprint of the primary key of the key
making the signature, &quot;%c&quot; into the signature count from the OpenPGP
smartcard, and &quot;%%&quot; results in a single &quot;%&quot;. %k, %K, and %f are only
meaningful when making a key signature (certification), and %c is only
meaningful when using the OpenPGP smartcard.
<P>
<DT id="348"><B>--known-notation </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Adds <I>name</I> to a list of known critical signature notations.  The
effect of this is that gpg will not mark a signature with a critical
signature notation of that name as bad.  Note that gpg already knows
by default about a few critical signatures notation names.
<P>
<DT id="349"><B>--sig-policy-url </B><I>string</I>

<DD>

<B>--cert-policy-url </B><I>string</I>


<B>--set-policy-url </B><I>string</I>

Use <I>string</I> as a Policy URL for signatures (rfc4880:5.2.3.20).  If
you prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet will
be flagged as critical. <B>--sig-policy-url</B> sets a policy url for
data signatures. <B>--cert-policy-url</B> sets a policy url for key
signatures (certifications). <B>--set-policy-url</B> sets both.
<P>
The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as well.
<P>
<DT id="350"><B>--sig-keyserver-url </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Use <I>string</I> as a preferred keyserver URL for data signatures. If
you prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the keyserver URL packet
will be flagged as critical.
<P>
The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as well.
<P>
<DT id="351"><B>--set-filename </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Use <I>string</I> as the filename which is stored inside messages.
This overrides the default, which is to use the actual filename of the
file being encrypted.  Using the empty string for <I>string</I>
effectively removes the filename from the output.
<P>
<DT id="352"><B>--for-your-eyes-only</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-for-your-eyes-only</B>

Set the `for your eyes only' flag in the message. This causes GnuPG to
refuse to save the file unless the <B>--output</B> option is given,
and PGP to use a &quot;secure viewer&quot; with a claimed Tempest-resistant font
to display the message. This option overrides <B>--set-filename</B>.
<B>--no-for-your-eyes-only</B> disables this option.
<P>
<DT id="353"><B>--use-embedded-filename</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-use-embedded-filename</B>

Try to create a file with a name as embedded in the data. This can be
a dangerous option as it enables overwriting files.  Defaults to no.
Note that the option <B>--output</B> overrides this option.
<P>
<DT id="354"><B>--cipher-algo </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Use <I>name</I> as cipher algorithm. Running the program with the
command <B>--version</B> yields a list of supported algorithms. If
this is not used the cipher algorithm is selected from the preferences
stored with the key. In general, you do not want to use this option as
it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
<B>--personal-cipher-preferences</B> is the safe way to accomplish the
same thing.
<P>
<DT id="355"><B>--digest-algo </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Use <I>name</I> as the message digest algorithm. Running the program
with the command <B>--version</B> yields a list of supported algorithms. In
general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to
violate the OpenPGP standard. <B>--personal-digest-preferences</B> is the
safe way to accomplish the same thing.
<P>
<DT id="356"><B>--compress-algo </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Use compression algorithm <I>name</I>. &quot;zlib&quot; is RFC-1950 ZLIB
compression. &quot;zip&quot; is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is used by PGP.
&quot;bzip2&quot; is a more modern compression scheme that can compress some
things better than zip or zlib, but at the cost of more memory used
during compression and decompression. &quot;uncompressed&quot; or &quot;none&quot;
disables compression. If this option is not used, the default
behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences to see which
algorithms the recipient supports. If all else fails, ZIP is used for
maximum compatibility.
<P>
ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as the compression
window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even better
compression results than that, but will use a significantly larger
amount of memory while compressing and decompressing. This may be
significant in low memory situations. Note, however, that PGP (all
versions) only supports ZIP compression. Using any algorithm other
than ZIP or &quot;none&quot; will make the message unreadable with PGP. In
general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to
violate the OpenPGP standard. <B>--personal-compress-preferences</B> is the
safe way to accomplish the same thing.
<P>
<DT id="357"><B>--cert-digest-algo </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Use <I>name</I> as the message digest algorithm used when signing a
key. Running the program with the command <B>--version</B> yields a
list of supported algorithms. Be aware that if you choose an algorithm
that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP implementations do not, then some
users will not be able to use the key signatures you make, or quite
possibly your entire key.
<P>
<DT id="358"><B>--disable-cipher-algo </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Never allow the use of <I>name</I> as cipher algorithm.
The given name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm
will still get disabled.
<P>
<DT id="359"><B>--disable-pubkey-algo </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Never allow the use of <I>name</I> as public key algorithm.
The given name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm
will still get disabled.
<P>
<DT id="360"><B>--throw-keyids</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-throw-keyids</B>

Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted messages. This helps to
hide the receivers of the message and is a limited countermeasure
against traffic analysis. ([Using a little social engineering
anyone who is able to decrypt the message can check whether one of the
other recipients is the one he suspects.])  On the receiving side, it may
slow down the decryption process because all available secret keys must
be tried.  <B>--no-throw-keyids</B> disables this option. This option
is essentially the same as using <B>--hidden-recipient</B> for all
recipients.
<P>
<DT id="361"><B>--not-dash-escaped</B>

<DD>
This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures
so that they can be used for patch files. You should not
send such an armored file via email because all spaces
and line endings are hashed too. You can not use this
option for data which has 5 dashes at the beginning of a
line, patch files don't have this. A special armor header
line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature option.
<P>
<DT id="362"><B>--escape-from-lines</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-escape-from-lines</B>

Because some mailers change lines starting with &quot;From &quot; to &quot;&gt;From &quot; it
is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating cleartext
signatures to prevent the mail system from breaking the signature. Note
that all other PGP versions do it this way too.  Enabled by
default. <B>--no-escape-from-lines</B> disables this option.
<P>
<DT id="363"><B>--passphrase-repeat </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Specify how many times <B>gpg</B> will request a new
passphrase be repeated.  This is useful for helping memorize a
passphrase.  Defaults to 1 repetition.
<P>
<DT id="364"><B>--passphrase-fd </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Read the passphrase from file descriptor <I>n</I>. Only the first line
will be read from file descriptor <I>n</I>. If you use 0 for <I>n</I>,
the passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can only be used if only
one passphrase is supplied.
<P>
Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the
option <B>--batch</B> has also been given. Since Version 2.1
the <B>--pinentry-mode</B> also needs to be set to <B>loopback</B>.
<P>
<DT id="365"><B>--passphrase-file </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Read the passphrase from file <I>file</I>. Only the first line will
be read from file <I>file</I>. This can only be used if only one
passphrase is supplied. Obviously, a passphrase stored in a file is
of questionable security if other users can read this file. Don't use
this option if you can avoid it.
<P>
Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the
option <B>--batch</B> has also been given. Since Version 2.1
the <B>--pinentry-mode</B> also needs to be set to <B>loopback</B>.
<P>
<DT id="366"><B>--passphrase </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Use <I>string</I> as the passphrase. This can only be used if only one
passphrase is supplied. Obviously, this is of very questionable
security on a multi-user system. Don't use this option if you can
avoid it.
<P>
Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the
option <B>--batch</B> has also been given. Since Version 2.1
the <B>--pinentry-mode</B> also needs to be set to <B>loopback</B>.
<P>
<DT id="367"><B>--pinentry-mode </B><I>mode</I>

are:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="368"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="369"><B>default</B>

<DD>
Use the default of the agent, which is <B>ask</B>.
<DT id="370"><B>ask</B>

<DD>
Force the use of the Pinentry.
<DT id="371"><B>cancel</B>

<DD>
Emulate use of Pinentry's cancel button.
<DT id="372"><B>error</B>

<DD>
Return a Pinentry error (``No Pinentry'').
<DT id="373"><B>loopback</B>

<DD>
Redirect Pinentry queries to the caller.  Note that in contrast to
Pinentry the user is not prompted again if he enters a bad password.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<DT id="374"><B>--no-symkey-cache</B>

<DD>
Disable the passphrase cache used for symmetrical en- and decryption.
This cache is based on the message specific salt value
(cf. <B>--s2k-mode</B>).
<P>
<DT id="375"><B>--request-origin </B><I>origin</I>

<DD>
Tell gpg to assume that the operation ultimately originated at
<I>origin</I>.  Depending on the origin certain restrictions are applied
and the Pinentry may include an extra note on the origin.  Supported
values for <I>origin</I> are: <B>local</B> which is the default,
<B>remote</B> to indicate a remote origin or <B>browser</B> for an
operation requested by a web browser.
<P>
<DT id="376"><B>--command-fd </B><I>n</I>

<DD>
This is a replacement for the deprecated shared-memory IPC mode.
If this option is enabled, user input on questions is not expected
from the TTY but from the given file descriptor. It should be used
together with <B>--status-fd</B>. See the file doc/DETAILS in the source
distribution for details on how to use it.
<P>
<DT id="377"><B>--command-file </B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Same as <B>--command-fd</B>, except the commands are read out of file
<I>file</I>
<P>
<DT id="378"><B>--allow-non-selfsigned-uid</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</B>

Allow the import and use of keys with user IDs which are not
self-signed. This is not recommended, as a non self-signed user ID is
trivial to forge. <B>--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</B> disables.
<P>
<DT id="379"><B>--allow-freeform-uid</B>

<DD>
Disable all checks on the form of the user ID while generating a new
one. This option should only be used in very special environments as
it does not ensure the de-facto standard format of user IDs.
<P>
<DT id="380"><B>--ignore-time-conflict</B>

<DD>
GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a signature
seems to be older than the key due to clock problems. This option
makes these checks just a warning. See also <B>--ignore-valid-from</B> for
timestamp issues on subkeys.
<P>
<DT id="381"><B>--ignore-valid-from</B>

<DD>
GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in the future.
This option allows the use of such keys and thus exhibits the
pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not use this option unless there
is some clock problem. See also <B>--ignore-time-conflict</B> for timestamp
issues with signatures.
<P>
<DT id="382"><B>--ignore-crc-error</B>

<DD>
The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC checksum against
transmission errors. Occasionally the CRC gets mangled somewhere on
the transmission channel but the actual content (which is protected by
the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay. This option allows GnuPG
to ignore CRC errors.
<P>
<DT id="383"><B>--ignore-mdc-error</B>

<DD>
This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a warning.
It is required to decrypt old messages which did not use an MDC.  It
may also be useful if a message is partially garbled, but it is
necessary to get as much data as possible out of that garbled message.
Be aware that a missing or failed MDC can be an indication of an
attack.  Use with great caution; see also option <B>--rfc2440</B>.
<P>
<DT id="384"><B>--allow-weak-digest-algos</B>

<DD>
Signatures made with known-weak digest algorithms are normally
rejected with an ``invalid digest algorithm'' message.  This option
allows the verification of signatures made with such weak algorithms.
MD5 is the only digest algorithm considered weak by default.  See also
<B>--weak-digest</B> to reject other digest algorithms.
<P>
<DT id="385"><B>--weak-digest </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak.  Signatures made over
weak digests algorithms are normally rejected. This option can be
supplied multiple times if multiple algorithms should be considered
weak.  See also <B>--allow-weak-digest-algos</B> to disable
rejection of weak digests.  MD5 is always considered weak, and does
not need to be listed explicitly.
<P>
<DT id="386"><B>--allow-weak-key-signatures</B>

<DD>
To avoid a minor risk of collision attacks on third-party key
signatures made using SHA-1, those key signatures are considered
invalid.  This options allows to override this restriction.
<P>
<DT id="387"><B>--no-default-keyring</B>

<DD>
Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings. Note that
GnuPG will not operate without any keyrings, so if you use this option
and do not provide alternate keyrings via <B>--keyring</B> or
<B>--secret-keyring</B>, then GnuPG will still use the default public or
secret keyrings.
<P>
<DT id="388"><B>--no-keyring</B>

<DD>
Do not use any keyring at all.  This overrides the default and all
options which specify keyrings.
<P>
<DT id="389"><B>--skip-verify</B>

<DD>
Skip the signature verification step. This may be
used to make the decryption faster if the signature
verification is not needed.
<P>
<DT id="390"><B>--with-key-data</B>

<DD>
Print key listings delimited by colons (like <B>--with-colons</B>) and
print the public key data.
<P>
<DT id="391"><B>--list-signatures</B>

<DD>

<B>--list-sigs</B>

Same as <B>--list-keys</B>, but the signatures are listed too.  This
command has the same effect as using <B>--list-keys</B> with
<B>--with-sig-list</B>.  Note that in contrast to
<B>--check-signatures</B> the key signatures are not verified.  This
command can be used to create a list of signing keys missing in the
local keyring; for example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="392"><DD>
<PRE>
      gpg --list-sigs --with-colons USERID | \
        awk -F: '$1==&quot;sig&quot; &amp;&amp; $2==&quot;?&quot; {if($13){print $13}else{print $5}}'
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
<DT id="393"><B>--fast-list-mode</B>

<DD>
Changes the output of the list commands to work faster; this is achieved
by leaving some parts empty. Some applications don't need the user ID
and the trust information given in the listings. By using this options
they can get a faster listing. The exact behaviour of this option may
change in future versions.  If you are missing some information, don't
use this option.
<P>
<DT id="394"><B>--no-literal</B>

<DD>
This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what it might be useful.
<P>
<DT id="395"><B>--set-filesize</B>

<DD>
This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what it might be useful.
<P>
<DT id="396"><B>--show-session-key</B>

<DD>
Display the session key used for one message. See
<B>--override-session-key</B> for the counterpart of this option.
<P>
We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the user should have
the freedom to decide whether to go to prison or to reveal the content
of one specific message without compromising all messages ever
encrypted for one secret key.
<P>
You can also use this option if you receive an encrypted message which
is abusive or offensive, to prove to the administrators of the
messaging system that the ciphertext transmitted corresponds to an
inappropriate plaintext so they can take action against the offending
user.
<P>
<DT id="397"><B>--override-session-key </B><I>string</I>

<DD>

<B>--override-session-key-fd </B><I>fd</I>

Don't use the public key but the session key <I>string</I> respective
the session key taken from the first line read from file descriptor
<I>fd</I>.  The format of this string is the same as the one printed by
<B>--show-session-key</B>. This option is normally not used but
comes handy in case someone forces you to reveal the content of an
encrypted message; using this option you can do this without handing
out the secret key.  Note that using <B>--override-session-key</B>
may reveal the session key to all local users via the global process
table.  Often it is useful to combine this option with
<B>--no-keyring</B>.
<P>
<DT id="398"><B>--ask-sig-expire</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-ask-sig-expire</B>

When making a data signature, prompt for an expiration time. If this
option is not specified, the expiration time set via
<B>--default-sig-expire</B> is used. <B>--no-ask-sig-expire</B>
disables this option.
<P>
<DT id="399"><B>--default-sig-expire</B>

<DD>
The default expiration time to use for signature expiration. Valid
values are &quot;0&quot; for no expiration, a number followed by the letter d
(for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for
example &quot;2m&quot; for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for five years), or an absolute
date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to &quot;0&quot;.
<P>
<DT id="400"><B>--ask-cert-expire</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-ask-cert-expire</B>

When making a key signature, prompt for an expiration time. If this
option is not specified, the expiration time set via
<B>--default-cert-expire</B> is used. <B>--no-ask-cert-expire</B>
disables this option.
<P>
<DT id="401"><B>--default-cert-expire</B>

<DD>
The default expiration time to use for key signature expiration.
Valid values are &quot;0&quot; for no expiration, a number followed by the
letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years)
(for example &quot;2m&quot; for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for five years), or an
absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to &quot;0&quot;.
<P>
<DT id="402"><B>--default-new-key-algo </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
This option can be used to change the default algorithms for key
generation. The <I>string</I> is similar to the arguments required for
the command <B>--quick-add-key</B> but slightly different.  For
example the current default of <B>&quot;rsa2048/cert,sign+rsa2048/encr&quot;</B>
(or <B>&quot;rsa3072&quot;</B>) can be changed to the value of what we currently
call future default, which is <B>&quot;ed25519/cert,sign+cv25519/encr&quot;</B>.
You need to consult the source code to learn the details.  Note that
the advanced key generation commands can always be used to specify a
key algorithm directly.
<P>
<DT id="403"><B>--allow-secret-key-import</B>

This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere.
<P>
<DT id="404"><B>--allow-multiple-messages</B>

<DD>
<DT id="405"><B>--no-allow-multiple-messages</B>

<DD>
Allow processing of multiple OpenPGP messages contained in a single file
or stream.  Some programs that call GPG are not prepared to deal with
multiple messages being processed together, so this option defaults to
no.  Note that versions of GPG prior to 1.4.7 always allowed multiple
messages.
<P>
Warning: Do not use this option unless you need it as a temporary
workaround!
<P>
<P>
<DT id="406"><B>--enable-special-filenames</B>

<DD>
This option enables a mode in which filenames of the form
'<I>-&amp;n</I>', where n is a non-negative decimal number,
refer to the file descriptor n and not to a file with that name.
<P>
<DT id="407"><B>--no-expensive-trust-checks</B>

<DD>
Experimental use only.
<P>
<DT id="408"><B>--preserve-permissions</B>

<DD>
Don't change the permissions of a secret keyring back to user
read/write only. Use this option only if you really know what you are doing.
<P>
<DT id="409"><B>--default-preference-list </B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Set the list of default preferences to <I>string</I>. This preference
list is used for new keys and becomes the default for &quot;setpref&quot; in the
edit menu.
<P>
<DT id="410"><B>--default-keyserver-url </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Set the default keyserver URL to <I>name</I>. This keyserver will be
used as the keyserver URL when writing a new self-signature on a key,
which includes key generation and changing preferences.
<P>
<DT id="411"><B>--list-config</B>

<DD>
Display various internal configuration parameters of GnuPG. This option
is intended for external programs that call GnuPG to perform tasks, and
is thus not generally useful. See the file '<I>doc/DETAILS</I>' in the
source distribution for the details of which configuration items may be
listed. <B>--list-config</B> is only usable with
<B>--with-colons</B> set.
<P>

<DD>
Display various internal configuration parameters of Libgcrypt.
<P>
<DT id="413"><B>--gpgconf-list</B>

This command is similar to <B>--list-config</B> but in general only
internally used by the <B>gpgconf</B> tool.
<P>
<DT id="414"><B>--gpgconf-test</B>

<DD>
This is more or less dummy action.  However it parses the configuration

Verify the signature of the file but do not output the data unless
requested.  The second form is used for detached signatures, where
<B>sigfile</B> is the detached signature (either ASCII armored or
binary) and <B>datafile</B> are the signed data; if this is not given, the name of the
file holding the signed data is constructed by cutting off the
extension (&quot;.asc&quot; or &quot;.sig&quot;) of <B>sigfile</B> or by asking the user
for the filename.  If the option <B>--output</B> is also used the
signed data is written to the file specified by that option; use
<B>-</B> to write the signed data to stdout.

<H2>HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID</H2>

<P>
There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG.  Some of them
are only valid for <B>gpg</B> others are only good for
<B>gpgsm</B>.  Here is the entire list of ways to specify a key:
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="427"><B>By key Id.</B>

<DD>
This format is deduced from the length of the string and its content or
<B>0x</B> prefix. The key Id of an X.509 certificate are the low 64 bits
of its SHA-1 fingerprint.  The use of key Ids is just a shortcut, for
all automated processing the fingerprint should be used.
<P>
When using <B>gpg</B> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to
force using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
calculate which primary or secondary key to use.
<P>
The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long form as
internally used by the OpenPGP protocol. You can see the long key ID
using the option <B>--with-colons</B>.

<P>
<P>
<DT id="429"><B>By fingerprint.</B>

<DD>
This format is deduced from the length of the string and its content or
the <B>0x</B> prefix.  Note, that only the 20 byte version fingerprint
is available with <B>gpgsm</B> (i.e. the SHA-1 hash of the
certificate).
<P>
When using <B>gpg</B> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to
force using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
calculate which primary or secondary key to use.
<P>
The best way to specify a key Id is by using the fingerprint.  This
avoids any ambiguities in case that there are duplicated key IDs.

if the primary private key is not stored on the disk to move them to
an external storage device.  Anyone who can access theses files is
able to revoke the corresponding key.  You may want to print them out.
You should backup all files in this directory and take care to keep
this backup closed away.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<P>
On older systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This
is necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory pages prevents the
operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain
passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk. If you get no
warning message about insecure memory your operating system supports
locking without being root. The program drops root privileges as soon
as locked memory is allocated.
<P>
Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to
``suspend to disk'' (also known as ``safe sleep'' or ``hibernate'').
This writes all memory to disk before going into a low power or even
powered off mode.  Unless measures are taken in the operating system
to protect the saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material
may be recoverable from it later.
<P>
Before you report a bug you should first search the mailing list
archives for similar problems and second check whether such a bug has
already been reported to our bug tracker at <B><A HREF="https://bugs.gnupg.org">https://bugs.gnupg.org</A></B>.
