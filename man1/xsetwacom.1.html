<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>SET COMMANDS</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="12"><B>set</B> device_name parameter [value]<DD>
Set the parameter value on the given device to the value provided. Note that
not all parameters are writable, some are read-only and result in an error
when trying to be modified.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

<P>

Not all parameters are available on all tools.  Use the get command with the
parameter or &quot;all&quot; parameter for specific input tool applicable parameters
and current settings.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="13"><B>Area</B> x1 y1 x2 y2<DD>
Set the tablet input area in device coordinates in the form top left
x/y and bottom right x/y. Top left and bottom right are defined in the
device's native orientation, regardless of the actual rotation currently
applied. Input outside of these coordinates will be clipped to the edges
of the area defined.  Default:  0 0 x2 y2; with x2 and y2 tablet specific.
<DT id="14"><B>Button</B> button-number [mapping]<DD>
Set a mapping for the specified button-number. Mappings take the form of
either a single numeric button or an 'action' to be performed. If no mapping
is provided, the default mapping is restored. If button-number is mapped
to 0, the Button event is ignored.
<P>
Numeric button mappings indicate what X11 button number the given button-number
should correspond to. For example, a mapping of &quot;3&quot; means a press of the given
button-number will produce a press of X11 button 3 (i.e. right click).
<P>
Action mappings allow button presses to perform many events. They take the form
of a string of keywords and arguments.
<P>
The &quot;key&quot; keyword is followed by a list of key names. These can optionally
be preceded by &quot;+&quot; for press and &quot;-&quot; for release. If +/- is not given,
press-and-release is assumed, except for modifier keys which are left pressed.
Key names can be X11 KeySyms or some aliases such as 'shift' or 'f1' (the
full list can be seen with the
<B>list modifiers</B>

command).
<P>
To assign a key that is not in the modifiers list, use the KeySym in
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h with the XK_ prefix removed or its actual value
as is. For example, XK_BackSpace should be specified as &quot;BackSpace&quot;. &quot;0xff80&quot;
can also be used to replace &quot;BackSpace&quot; since it's the unique KeySym value of
Backspace key.
<P>
Here is a combined example: &quot;key +a shift b shift -a 0xff0d&quot; converts the
button into a series of keystrokes. In this example, &quot;press a, press shift,
press and release b, release shift, release a, then press and release enter&quot;.
&quot;key +a +shift b -shift -a 0xff0d&quot; does the same thing.
<P>
The &quot;button&quot; keyword is similar except that its arguments are X11 button
numbers.
<P>
The &quot;modetoggle&quot; keyword is also recognized; it takes no arguments,
and toggles the device mode between relative and absolute pointer tracking.
<P>
The &quot;pan&quot; keyword causes the driver to send scroll events while the pen
is dragged. This makes it easy to scroll through lists and documents,
pan around 2D canvases, and zoom in/out of 3D scenes (exact behavior
depends on application interpretation of scrollwheel events). Dragging
the pen up/down will send scrollwheel down/up events; dragging it left/right
will send scrollwheel right/left events.
<P>
The events in the action mapping are sent when the physical button is pressed.
If the action mapping leaves any buttons or keys pressed (such as a modifier
key), they will be released when the physical button is released.
<P>
Multiple keywords may be present in one action if desired: for example
&quot;key +ctrl button 5 key -ctrl&quot;. Each keyword takes all arguments until the
next keyword.
<P>
A maximum of 256 presses and/or releases can be specified in an action mapping.
<P>
The driver can only simulate physical key events but not keysyms and
xsetwacom translates the mapping sequence into such events. Thus,
symbols on the same physical key will generate the same event. For
example, '1' and '!' are on the same key on a US keyboard and thus have the
same keycode).  For access to keys on a higher shift level, the sequence
should be entered as it would be typed on a physical keyboard. For example,
a exclamation mark is entered by the sequence of &quot;key +shift 1 -shift&quot;.
<DT id="15"><B>BindToSerial</B> [serial|0]<DD>
Bind the device to the tool with the specified serial number. Once bound,
the device will ignore events from other tools. A serial of 0 means the
device is unbound and will react to any tool of the matching type.
Default: 0
<DT id="16"><B>MapToOutput</B> [output]<DD>
Map the tablet's input area to a given output (e.g. &quot;VGA1&quot;). Output names may
either be the name of a head available through the XRandR extension, or an
X11 geometry string of the form WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y. To switch to the next
available output, the &quot;next&quot; keyword is also supported. This will cycle
between the individual monitors connected to the system, and then the entire
desktop. The mapping may be reset to the entire desktop at any time with the
output name &quot;desktop&quot;. Users of the NVIDIA binary driver should use the output
names &quot;HEAD-0&quot; and &quot;HEAD-1&quot; until the driver supports XRandR 1.2 or later.
<P>
The output mapping configuration is a onetime setting and does not track output
reconfigurations; the command needs to be re-run whenever the output
configuration changes. When used with tablet rotation, the tablet must be
rotated before it is mapped to the new screen. This parameter is write-only
and cannot be queried.
<DT id="17"><B>Mode</B> Absolute|Relative<DD>
Set the device mode as either Relative or Absolute. Relative means pointer
tracking for the device will function like a mouse, whereas Absolute means
the pointer corresponds to the device's actual position on the tablet or
tablet PC screen.  Default:  Absolute for stylus, eraser and tablet PC touch;
Relative for cursor and tablet touch.
<DT id="18"><B>PressureCurve</B> x1 y1 x2 y2<DD>
A Bezier curve of third order, composed of two anchor points (0,0 and 100,100)
and two user modifiable control points that define the curve's shape.  Raise
the curve (x1&lt;y1 x2&lt;y2) to &quot;soften&quot; the feel and lower the curve (x1&gt;y1 x2&gt;y2)
for a &quot;firmer&quot; feel.  Sigmoid shaped curves are permitted (x1&gt;y1 x2&lt;y2 or
x1&lt;y1 x2&gt;y2).  Default:  0 0 100 100, a linear curve; range of 0 to 100 for
all four values.
<DT id="19"><B>RawSample</B> level<DD>
Set the sample window size (a sliding average sampling window) for incoming
input tool raw data points.  Default:  4, range of 1 to 20.
<DT id="20"><B>Rotate</B> none|half|cw|ccw<DD>
Set the tablet to the given rotation:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;none:&nbsp;the&nbsp;tablet&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;rotated&nbsp;and&nbsp;uses&nbsp;its&nbsp;natural&nbsp;rotation
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;half:&nbsp;the&nbsp;tablet&nbsp;is&nbsp;rotated&nbsp;by&nbsp;180&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;(upside-down)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;cw:&nbsp;the&nbsp;tablet&nbsp;is&nbsp;rotated&nbsp;90&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;clockwise
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;ccw:&nbsp;the&nbsp;tablet&nbsp;is&nbsp;rotated&nbsp;90&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;counter-clockwise
<P>
Rotation is a tablet-wide option: rotation of one tool affects all other tools
associated with the same tablet. When the tablet is physically rotated, rotate
any tool to the corresponding orientation.  Default:  none
<DT id="21"><B>Suppress</B> level<DD>
Set the delta (difference) cutoff level for further processing of incoming
input tool coordinate values.  For example a X or Y coordinate event will be
sent only if the change between the current X or Y coordinate and the
previous one is greater than the Suppress value.  The same applies to
pressure level (Z coordinate) and Tilt rotation values.  With a current
absolute wheel (AbsWheel) or Tilt value the delta between it and the
previous value must be equal to or greater than the Suppress value in order
to be sent on.  Suppress is a tablet wide parameter.  A specified delta
level for one input tool is applied to all input tool coordinates.  To
disable suppression use a level of 0.  Default:  2, range of 0 to 100.
<DT id="22"><B>TabletDebugLevel</B> level<DD>
Set the debug level for this tablet to the given level. This only affects
code paths that are shared between several tools on the same physical
tablet. A higher level means more fine-grained debug messages, a level of 0
turns debugging off for this tool. Requires the driver to be built with
debugging enabled. See also ToolDebugLevel.  Default:  0, range of 0 to 12.
<DT id="23"><B>TabletPCButton</B> on|off<DD>
If on, the stylus must be in contact with the screen for a stylus side button
to work.  If off, stylus buttons will work once the stylus is in proximity
of the tablet (regardless of whether it is touching the screen).  Default:  on
for Tablet PCs; off for all other models.
<DT id="24"><B>ToolSerialPrevious</B><DD>
Get the serial number of the tool that was last in proximity last. This
serial number is updated whenever the tool goes out of proximity. If the
current tool went out of proximity once, this serial number is the one of
the current tool. This is a read-only parameter.
<DT id="25"><B>Touch</B> on|off<DD>
If on, touch events are reported to userland, i.e., system cursor moves when
user touches the tablet. If off, touch events are ignored. Default: on for
devices that support touch; off for all other models.
<DT id="26"><B>HWTouchSwitchState</B> on|off<DD>
If on, it means touch switch is turned off. That is, touch events are reported
to userland. If off, touch switch is turned on, i.e., touch events are ignored.
This is a read-only parameter. Initial touch switch state is retrieved from the
kernel when X driver starts.
<DT id="27"><B>CursorProximity</B> distance<DD>
Set the distance at which a relative tool is treated as being out of proximity.
Beyond this distance the cursor will stop responding to tool motion. The
default value for pucks is 10 (Intuos Pro) or 42 (Intuos/Bamboo). The default
value for pens is 30.
<DT id="28"><B>Threshold</B> level<DD>
Set the minimum pressure necessary to generate a Button event for the stylus
tip, eraser, or touch.  The pressure levels of all tablets are normalized to
2048 levels irregardless of the actual hardware supported levels.  This
parameter is independent of the PressureCurve parameter.  Default:  27,
range of 0 to 2047.
<DT id="29"><B>ToolDebugLevel</B> level<DD>
Set the debug level for this tool to the given level. This only affects
code paths that are specific to a given tool. A higher level means more
fine-grained debug messages, a level of 0 turns debugging off for this
tool. Requires the driver to be built with debugging enabled. See also
TabletDebugLevel.  Default:  0, range of 0 to 12.
<DT id="30"><B>PressureRecalibration</B> on|off<DD>
If the initial pressure of a device is != 0 the driver recalibrates
the pressure range. This is to account for worn out devices.
The downside is that when the user hits the tablet very hard the
initial pressure reading may be unequal to zero even for a perfectly
good pen. If the consecutive pressure readings are not higher than
the initial pressure by a threshold no button event will be generated.
This option allows to disable the recalibration.  Default:  on
<DT id="31"><B>PanScrollThreshold</B> distance<DD>
This specifies the distance the pen must move (in tablet units) before
a scroll event is generated when using the &quot;pan&quot; action. Smaller values
will require less distance and be more sensitive. Larger values will
require more distance and be less sensitive.  Default: 1300 or 2600
depending on tablet resolution (corresponds to 13 mm of distance).
