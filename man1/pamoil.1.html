<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Reads a Netpbm image as input.
Does an &quot;oil transfer&quot;, and writes the same type of Netpbm image as output.
<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
<P>

The oil transfer is described in &quot;Beyond Photography&quot; by Holzmann,
chapter 4, photo 7.
It's a sort of localized smearing.
<P>
The smearing works like this: First, assume a grayscale image.  For
each pixel in the image,
<B>pamoil</B>

looks at a square neighborhood around it.  
<B>pamoil</B>

determines what is the most common pixel intensity in the
neighborhood, and puts a pixel of that intensity into the output in
the same position as the input pixel.
<P>
For color images, or any arbitrary multi-channel image, 
<B>pamoil</B>

computes each channel (e.g. red, green, and blue) separately the same
way as the grayscale case above.
<P>
At the edges of the image, where the regular neighborhood would run off
the edge of the image, 
<B>pamoil</B>

uses a clipped neighborhood.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>-n </B><I>size</I>

<DD>
This is the size of the neighborhood used in the smearing.  The neighborhood
is this many pixels in all four directions.
<P>
The default is 3.
