<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>Vimdiff</B>

starts
<B>Vim</B>

on two (or three or four) files.
Each file gets its own window.
The differences between the files are highlighted.
This is a nice way to inspect changes and to move changes from one version
to another version of the same file.
<P>

See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+vim">vim</A>(1) for details about Vim itself.
<P>

When started as
<B>gvimdiff</B>

the GUI will be started, if available.
<P>

In each window the 'diff' option will be set, which causes the differences
to be highlighted.
<BR>

The 'wrap' and 'scrollbind' options are set to make the text look good.
<BR>

The 'foldmethod' option is set to &quot;diff&quot;, which puts ranges of lines without
changes in a fold.  'foldcolumn' is set to two to make it easy to spot the
folds and open or close them.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

Vertical splits are used to align the lines, as if the &quot;-O&quot; argument was used.
To use horizontal splits instead, use the &quot;-o&quot; argument.
<P>

For all other arguments see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+vim">vim</A>(1).
