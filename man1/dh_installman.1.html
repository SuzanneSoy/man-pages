dh_installman - install man pages into package build directories
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>



<B>dh_installman</B> [<I>debhelper options</I>] [<I>manpage</I> ...]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



<B>dh_installman</B> is a debhelper program that handles installing man
pages into the correct locations in package build directories.
<P>

In compat 10 and earlier, this program was primarily for when
upstream's build system does not properly install them as a part of
its install step (or it does not have an install step).  In compat 11
and later, it also supports the default searchdir plus --sourcedir
like <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dh_install">dh_install</A></B>(1) and has the advantage that it respects the nodoc
build profile (unlike <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dh_install">dh_install</A></B>(1)).
<P>

Even if you prefer to use <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dh_install">dh_install</A></B>(1) for installing the manpages,
<B>dh_installman</B> can still be useful for converting the manpage encoding
to <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> and for converting <I>.so</I> links (as described below).  However,
that part happens automatically without any explicit configuration.
<P>

You tell <B>dh_installman</B> what man pages go in your packages, and it figures out
where to install them based on the section field in their <B>.TH</B> or
<B>.Dt</B> line. If you have a properly formatted <B>.TH</B> or <B>.Dt</B> line,
your man page will be installed into the right directory, with the
right name (this includes proper handling of pages with a subsection,
like <B>3perl</B>, which are placed in <I>man3</I>, and given an extension of
<I>.3perl</I>). If your <B>.TH</B> or <B>.Dt</B> line is incorrect or missing, the
program may guess wrong based on the file extension.
<P>

It also supports translated man pages, by looking for extensions
like <I>.ll.8</I> and <I>.ll_LL.8</I>, or by use of the <B>--language</B> switch.
<P>

If <B>dh_installman</B> seems to install a man page into the wrong section or with
the wrong extension, this is because the man page has the wrong section
listed in its <B>.TH</B> or <B>.Dt</B> line. Edit the man page and correct the
section, and <B>dh_installman</B> will follow suit. See <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+man">man</A></B>(7) for details
about the <B>.TH</B> section, and <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+mdoc">mdoc</A></B>(7) for the <B>.Dt</B> section. If
<B>dh_installman</B> seems to install a man page into a directory
like <I>/usr/share/man/pl/man1/</I>, that is because your program has a
name like <I>foo.pl</I>, and <B>dh_installman</B> assumes that means it is translated
into Polish. Use <B>--language=C</B> to avoid this.
<P>

After the man page installation step, <B>dh_installman</B> will check to see if
any of the man pages in the temporary directories of any of the packages it
is acting on contain <I>.so</I> links. If so, it changes them to symlinks.
<P>

Also, <B>dh_installman</B> will use man to guess the character encoding of each
manual page and convert it to <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8.</FONT> If the guesswork fails for some
reason, you can override it using an encoding declaration. See
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+manconv">manconv</A></B>(1) for details.
<P>

From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, <B>dh_install</B> will fall back to
looking in <I>debian/tmp</I> for files, if it does not find them in the current
directory (or wherever you've told it to look using <B>--sourcedir</B>).

<H2>FILES</H2>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">debian/<I>package</I>.manpages<DD>


Lists man pages to be installed.


<P>


Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
documented in <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+debhelper">debhelper</A></B>(7).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2"><B>-A</B>, <B>--all</B><DD>


Install all files specified by command line parameters in <FONT SIZE="-1">ALL</FONT> packages
acted on.
<DT id="3"><B>--language=</B><I>ll</I><DD>


Use this to specify that the man pages being acted on are written in the
specified language.
<DT id="4"><B>--sourcedir=</B><I>dir</I><DD>


Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.  This option
requires compat 11 or later (it is silently ignored in compat 10 or earlier).


<P>


Note that this is not the same as the <B>--sourcedirectory</B> option used
by the <B>dh_auto_</B><I>*</I> commands. You rarely need to use this option, since
<B>dh_installman</B> automatically looks for files in <I>debian/tmp</I> in debhelper
compatibility level 11 and above.
<DT id="5"><I>manpage</I> ...<DD>


Install these man pages into the first package acted on. (Or in all
packages if <B>-A</B> is specified).
</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>



An example <I>debian/manpages</I> file could look like this:
<P>



<PRE>
  doc/man/foo.1
  # Translations
  doc/man/foo.da.1
  doc/man/foo.de.1
  doc/man/foo.fr.1
  # NB: The following line is considered a polish translation
  # of &quot;foo.1&quot; (and not a manpage written in perl called &quot;foo.pl&quot;)
  doc/man/foo.pl.1
  # ...

<H2>NOTES</H2>



An older version of this program, <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dh_installmanpages">dh_installmanpages</A></B>(1), is still used
by some packages, and so is still included in debhelper.
It is, however, deprecated, due to its counterintuitive and inconsistent
interface. Use this program instead.
