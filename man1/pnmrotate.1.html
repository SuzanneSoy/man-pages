pnmrotate - rotate a portable anymap by some angle

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>pnmrotate</B>

[<B>-noantialias</B>]

<I>angle</I>

[<I>pnmfile</I>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Reads a portable anymap as input.
Rotates it by the specified angle
and produces a portable anymap as output.
<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
If the input file is in color, the output will be too,
otherwise it will be grayscale.
The angle is in degrees (floating point), measured counter-clockwise.
It can be negative, but it should be between -90 and 90.
Also, for rotations greater than 45 degrees you may get better results
if you first use
<I>pnmflip</I>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
to do a 90 degree rotation and then
<I>pnmrotate</I>

less than 45 degrees back the other direction
<P>

The rotation algorithm is Alan Paeth's three-shear method.
Each shear is implemented by looping over the source pixels and distributing
fractions to each of the destination pixels.
This has an &quot;anti-aliasing&quot; effect - it avoids jagged edges and similar
artifacts.
<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
However, it also means that the original colors or gray levels in the image
are modified.
If you need to keep precisely the same set of colors, you can use the
<B>-noantialias</B>

flag.  This does the shearing by moving pixels without changing their values.
If you want anti-aliasing and don't care about the precise colors, but
still need a limited *number* of colors, you can run the result through
<I>ppmquant</I>.

All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
