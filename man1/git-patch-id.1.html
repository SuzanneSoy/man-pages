git-patch-id - Compute unique ID for a patch
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
<PRE>
<I>git patch-id</I> [--stable | --unstable]
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Read a patch from the standard input and compute the patch ID for it.
<P>
A &quot;patch ID&quot; is nothing but a sum of SHA-1 of the file diffs associated with a patch, with whitespace and line numbers ignored. As such, it's &quot;reasonably stable&quot;, but at the same time also reasonably unique, i.e., two patches that have the same &quot;patch ID&quot; are almost guaranteed to be the same thing.
<P>
IOW, you can use this thing to look for likely duplicate commits.
<P>
When dealing with <I>git diff-tree</I> output, it takes advantage of the fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the commit, and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first string is the patch ID, and the second string is the commit ID. This can be used to make a mapping from patch ID to commit ID.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

--stable
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
Use a &quot;stable&quot; sum of hashes as the patch ID. With this option:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
&bull;


Reordering file diffs that make up a patch does not affect the ID. In particular, two patches produced by comparing the same two trees with two different settings for &quot;-O&lt;orderfile&gt;&quot; result in the same patch ID signature, thereby allowing the computed result to be used as a key to index some meta-information about the change between the two trees;
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3"><DD>
&bull;


Result is different from the value produced by git 1.9 and older or produced when an &quot;unstable&quot; hash (see --unstable below) is configured - even when used on a diff output taken without any use of &quot;-O&lt;orderfile&gt;&quot;, thereby making existing databases storing such &quot;unstable&quot; or historical patch-ids unusable.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="4"><DD>



<PRE>
This is the default if patchid.stable is set to true.
</PRE>

</DL>




</DL>

</DL>

<P>

--unstable
<DL COMPACT><DT id="5"><DD>
Use an &quot;unstable&quot; hash as the patch ID. With this option, the result produced is compatible with the patch-id value produced by git 1.9 and older. Users with pre-existing databases storing patch-ids produced by git 1.9 and older (who do not deal with reordered patches) may want to use this option.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="6"><DD>



<PRE>
This is the default.
