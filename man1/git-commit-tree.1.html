git-commit-tree - Create a new commit object
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
<PRE>
<I>git commit-tree</I> &lt;tree&gt; [(-p &lt;parent&gt;)...]
<I>git commit-tree</I> [(-p &lt;parent&gt;)...] [-S[&lt;keyid&gt;]] [(-m &lt;message&gt;)...]
                  [(-F &lt;file&gt;)...] &lt;tree&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
This is usually not what an end user wants to run directly. See <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git-commit">git-commit</A></B>(1) instead.
<P>
Creates a new commit object based on the provided tree object and emits the new commit object id on stdout. The log message is read from the standard input, unless <B>-m</B> or <B>-F</B> options are given.
<P>
The <B>-m</B> and <B>-F</B> options can be given any number of times, in any order. The commit log message will be composed in the order in which the options are given.
<P>
A commit object may have any number of parents. With exactly one parent, it is an ordinary commit. Having more than one parent makes the commit a merge between several lines of history. Initial (root) commits have no parents.
<P>
While a tree represents a particular directory state of a working directory, a commit represents that state in &quot;time&quot;, and explains how to get there.
<P>
Normally a commit would identify a new &quot;HEAD&quot; state, and while Git doesn't care where you save the note about that state, in practice we tend to just write the result to the file that is pointed at by <B>.git/HEAD</B>, so that we can always see what the last committed state was.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

&lt;tree&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
An existing tree object.
</DL>

<P>

-p &lt;parent&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
Each
<B>-p</B>
indicates the id of a parent commit object.
</DL>

<P>

-m &lt;message&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3"><DD>
A paragraph in the commit log message. This can be given more than once and each &lt;message&gt; becomes its own paragraph.
</DL>

<P>

-F &lt;file&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT id="4"><DD>
Read the commit log message from the given file. Use
<B>-</B>
to read from the standard input. This can be given more than once and the content of each file becomes its own paragraph.
</DL>

<P>

-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;]
<DL COMPACT><DT id="5"><DD>
GPG-sign commits. The
<B>keyid</B>
argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space.
</DL>

<P>

--no-gpg-sign
<DL COMPACT><DT id="6"><DD>
Do not GPG-sign commit, to countermand a
<B>--gpg-sign</B>
option given earlier on the command line.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMIT INFORMATION</H2>

<P>
A commit encapsulates:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="7"><DD>
&bull;


all parent object ids
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="8"><DD>
&bull;


author name, email and date
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="9"><DD>
&bull;


committer name and email and the commit time.
</DL>

<P>
A commit comment is read from stdin. If a changelog entry is not provided via &quot;&lt;&quot; redirection, <I>git commit-tree</I> will just wait for one to be entered and terminated with ^D.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DATE FORMATS</H2>

<P>
The <B>GIT_AUTHOR_DATE</B>, <B>GIT_COMMITTER_DATE</B> environment variables support the following date formats:
<P>

Git internal format
<DL COMPACT><DT id="10"><DD>
It is
<B>&lt;unix timestamp&gt; &lt;time zone offset&gt;</B>, where
<B>&lt;unix timestamp&gt;</B>
is the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch.
<B>&lt;time zone offset&gt;</B>
is a positive or negative offset from UTC. For example CET (which is 1 hour ahead of UTC) is
<B>+0100</B>.
</DL>

<P>

RFC 2822
<DL COMPACT><DT id="11"><DD>
The standard email format as described by RFC 2822, for example
<B>Thu, 07 Apr 2005 22:13:13 +0200</B>.
</DL>

<P>

ISO 8601
<DL COMPACT><DT id="12"><DD>
Time and date specified by the ISO 8601 standard, for example
<B>2005-04-07T22:13:13</B>. The parser accepts a space instead of the
<B>T</B>
character as well.
<P>



<DL COMPACT><DT id="13"><DD>



<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<B>Note</B>
</FONT>
<BR>

In addition, the date part is accepted in the following formats:
<B>YYYY.MM.DD</B>,
<B>MM/DD/YYYY</B>
and
<B>DD.MM.YYYY</B>.
<P>
</DL>

</DL>

<H2>DISCUSSION</H2>

<P>
Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="14"><DD>
&bull;


The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There is no encoding translation at the core level.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="15"><DD>
&bull;


Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as path names in command line arguments, environment variables and config files (<B>.git/config</B>
(see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git-config">git-config</A></B>(1)),
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+gitignore">gitignore</A></B>(5),
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+gitattributes">gitattributes</A></B>(5)
and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+gitmodules">gitmodules</A></B>(5)).
<P>
Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using non-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa. Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="16"><DD>
&bull;


Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other extended ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but
<I>not</I>
UTF-16/32, EBCDIC and CJK multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).
</DL>

<P>
Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it. However, there are a few things to keep in mind.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="17"><DD>
 1.


<I>git commit</I>
and
<I>git commit-tree</I>
issues a warning if the commit log message given to it does not look like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way to say this is to have i18n.commitencoding in
<B>.git/config</B>
file, like this:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="18"><DD>



<PRE>
[i18n]
        commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
<B>i18n.commitEncoding</B>
in its
<B>encoding</B>
header. This is to help other people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies that the commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="19"><DD>
 2.


<I>git log</I>,
<I>git show</I>,
<I>git blame</I>
and friends look at the
<B>encoding</B>
header of a commit object, and try to re-code the log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. You can specify the desired output encoding with
<B>i18n.logOutputEncoding</B>
in
<B>.git/config</B>
file, like this:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT id="20"><DD>



<PRE>
[i18n]
        logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
<B>i18n.commitEncoding</B>
is used instead.
</DL>

<P>
Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log message when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit object level, because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.
