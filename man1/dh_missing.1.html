<H2>NAME</H2>

dh_missing - check for missing files
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>



<B>dh_missing</B> [<B>-X</B><I>item</I>] [<B>--sourcedir=</B><I>dir</I>] [<I>debhelperÂ options</I>]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



<B>dh_missing</B> compares the list of installed files with the files in
the source directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the source
directory were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on stderr
about that (<B>--list-missing</B>) or fail (<B>--fail-missing</B>).
<P>

Please note that in compat 11 and earlier without either of these
options, <B>dh_missing</B> will silently do nothing.  From compat 12 on,
<B>--list-missing</B> is the default.
<P>

This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make sure that
you don't miss installing newly added files in new upstream releases.
<P>

Remember to test different kinds of builds (dpkg-buildpackage -A/-B/...) as
you may experience varying results when only a subset of the packages are
built.

<H2>FILES</H2>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">debian/not-installed<DD>


List the files that are deliberately not installed in <I>any</I> binary
package.  Paths listed in this file are ignored by <B>dh_missing</B>.
However, it is <B>not</B> a method to exclude files from being installed
by any of the debhelper tool.  If you want a tool to not install a
given file, please use its <B>--exclude</B> option (where available).


<P>


<B>dh_missing</B> will expand wildcards in this file (since debhelper 11.1).
Wildcards without matches will be ignored.


<P>


Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
documented in <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+debhelper">debhelper</A></B>(7).

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2"><B>--list-missing</B><DD>


Warn on stderr about source files not installed to somewhere.


<P>


Note that many dh-tools acting on a path will mark the path as
installed even if it has been excluded via <B>-X</B> or <B>--exclude</B>.
This is also seen when a dh-tool is acting on a directory and
exclusion is used to ignore some files in the directory.  In either
case, this will make <B>dh_missing</B> silently assume the excluded files
have been handled.


<P>


This is the default in compat 12 and later.
<DT id="3"><B>--fail-missing</B><DD>


This option is like <B>--list-missing</B>, except if a file was missed, it will
not only list the missing files, but also fail with a nonzero exit code.
