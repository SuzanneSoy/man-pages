<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAB"></A>
<P>

In the simplest case
<B>strace</B>

runs the specified
<I>command</I>

until it exits.
It intercepts and records the system calls which are called
by a process and the signals which are received by a process.
The name of each system call, its arguments and its return value
are printed on standard error or to the file specified with the
<B>-o</B>

option.
<P>

<B>strace</B>

is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.
System administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find
it invaluable for solving problems with
programs for which the source is not readily available since
they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.
Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that
a great deal can be learned about a system and its system calls by
tracing even ordinary programs.  And programmers will find that
since system calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
interface, a close examination of this boundary is very
useful for bug isolation, sanity checking and
attempting to capture race conditions.
<P>

Each line in the trace contains the system call name, followed
by its arguments in parentheses and its return value.
An example from stracing the command &quot;cat /dev/null&quot; is:

<P>

<PRE>
open(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, O_RDONLY) = 3

</PRE>


<P>

Errors (typically a return value of -1) have the errno symbol
and error string appended.

<P>

<PRE>
open(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;, O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

</PRE>


<P>

Signals are printed as signal symbol and decoded siginfo structure.
An excerpt from stracing and interrupting the command &quot;sleep 666&quot; is:

<P>

<PRE>
sigsuspend([] &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
--- SIGINT {si_signo=SIGINT, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=...} ---
+++ killed by SIGINT +++

</PRE>


<P>

If a system call is being executed and meanwhile another one is being called
from a different thread/process then
<B>strace</B>

will try to preserve the order of those events and mark the ongoing call as
being
<I>unfinished</I>.

When the call returns it will be marked as
<I>resumed</I>.


<P>

<PRE>
[pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
[pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
[pid 28772] &lt;... select resumed&gt; )      = 1 (in [3])

</PRE>


<P>

Interruption of a (restartable) system call by a signal delivery is processed
differently as kernel terminates the system call and also arranges its
immediate reexecution after the signal handler completes.

<P>

<PRE>
read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1)              = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGALRM ... ---
rt_sigreturn(0xe)                       = 0
read(0, &quot;&quot;, 1)                          = 0

</PRE>


<P>

Arguments are printed in symbolic form with passion.
This example shows the shell performing &quot;&gt;&gt;xyzzy&quot; output redirection:

<P>

<PRE>
open(&quot;xyzzy&quot;, O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3

</PRE>


<P>

Here, the third argument of
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+open">open</A></B>(2)

is decoded by breaking down the
flag argument into its three bitwise-OR constituents and printing the
mode value in octal by tradition.  Where the traditional or native
usage differs from ANSI or POSIX, the latter forms are preferred.
In some cases,
<B>strace</B>

output is proven to be more readable than the source.
<P>

Structure pointers are dereferenced and the members are displayed
as appropriate.  In most cases, arguments are formatted in the most C-like
fashion possible.
For example, the essence of the command &quot;ls -l /dev/null&quot; is captured as:

<P>

<PRE>
lstat(&quot;/dev/null&quot;, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(0x1, 0x3), ...}) = 0

</PRE>


<P>

Notice how the 'struct stat' argument is dereferenced and how each member is
displayed symbolically.  In particular, observe how the
<B>st_mode</B>

member is carefully decoded into a bitwise-OR of symbolic and numeric values.
Also notice in this example that the first argument to
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+lstat">lstat</A></B>(2)

is an input to the system call and the second argument is an output.
Since output arguments are not modified if the system call fails, arguments may
not always be dereferenced.  For example, retrying the &quot;ls -l&quot; example
with a non-existent file produces the following line:

<P>

<PRE>
lstat(&quot;/foo/bar&quot;, 0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

</PRE>


<P>

In this case the porch light is on but nobody is home.
<P>

Syscalls unknown to
<B>strace</B>

are printed raw, with the unknown system call number printed in hexadecimal form
and prefixed with &quot;syscall_&quot;:

<P>

<PRE>
syscall_0xbad(0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)

</PRE>


<P>

<P>

Character pointers are dereferenced and printed as C strings.
Non-printing characters in strings are normally represented by
ordinary C escape codes.
Only the first
<I>strsize</I>

(32 by default) bytes of strings are printed;
longer strings have an ellipsis appended following the closing quote.
Here is a line from &quot;ls -l&quot; where the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+getpwuid">getpwuid</A></B>(3)

library routine is reading the password file:

<P>

<PRE>
read(3, &quot;root::0:0:System Administrator:/&quot;..., 1024) = 422

</PRE>


<P>

While structures are annotated using curly braces, simple pointers
and arrays are printed using square brackets with commas separating
elements.  Here is an example from the command
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+id">id</A></B>(1)

on a system with supplementary group ids:

<P>

<PRE>
getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2

</PRE>


<P>

On the other hand, bit-sets are also shown using square brackets,
but set elements are separated only by a space.
Here is the shell, preparing to execute an external command:

<P>

<PRE>
sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TTOU], []) = 0

</PRE>


<P>

Here, the second argument is a bit-set of two signals,
<B>SIGCHLD</B> and <B>SIGTTOU</B>.

In some cases, the bit-set is so full that printing out the unset
elements is more valuable.  In that case, the bit-set is prefixed by
a tilde like this:

<P>

<PRE>
sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[], NULL) = 0

</PRE>


<P>

Here, the second argument represents the full set of all signals.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>-e </B><I>expr</I>

<DD>
A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace
or how to trace them.  The format of the expression is:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3"><DD>
[,<I>qualifier/</I><B>=</B>][<B>!</B>],<I>value/</I>[<B>,</B>,<I>value/</I>]...
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="4"><DD>
where
<I>qualifier</I>

is one of
<B>trace</B>,

<B>abbrev</B>,

<B>verbose</B>,

<B>raw</B>,

<B>signal</B>,

<B>read</B>,

<B>write</B>,

<B>fault</B>,

<B>inject</B>,

<B>status</B>,

or
<B>kvm</B>,

and
<I>value</I>

is a qualifier-dependent symbol or number.  The default
qualifier is
<B>trace</B>.

Using an exclamation mark negates the set of values.  For example,
<B>-e</B>&nbsp;<B>open</B>

means literally
<B>-e</B>&nbsp;<B>trace</B>=<B>open</B>

which in turn means trace only the
<B>open</B>

system call.  By contrast,
<B>-e</B>&nbsp;<B>trace</B>=!<B>open</B>

means to trace every system call except
<B>open</B>.

In addition, the special values
<B>all</B>

and
<B>none</B>

have the obvious meanings.
<DT id="5"><DD>
Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history
expansion even inside quoted arguments.  If so, you must escape
the exclamation point with a backslash.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="6"><B>-E&nbsp;</B><I>var</I>=,<I>val</I><DD>

<B>--env</B>=<B></B><I>var</I>=<B></B><I>val</I>

Run command with
<I>var</I>=<I>val</I>

in its list of environment variables.
<DT id="7"><B>-E </B><I>var</I>

<DD>

<B>--env</B>=<B></B><I>var</I>

Remove
<I>var</I>

from the inherited list of environment variables before passing it on to
the command.
<DT id="8"><B>-p </B><I>pid</I>

<DD>

<B>--attach</B>=<B></B><I>pid</I>

Attach to the process with the process
<FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT>
<I>pid</I>

and begin tracing.
The trace may be terminated
at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal
(<B>CTRL-C</B>).

<B>strace</B>

will respond by detaching itself from the traced process(es)
leaving it (them) to continue running.
Multiple
<B>-p</B>

options can be used to attach to many processes in addition to
<I>command</I>

(which is optional if at least one
<B>-p</B>

option is given).
<B>-p</B>

&quot;`pidof PROG`&quot; syntax is supported.
<DT id="9"><B>-u </B><I>username</I>

<DD>

<B>--user</B>=<B></B><I>username</I>

Run command with the user <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT>, group <FONT SIZE="-2">ID</FONT>, and
supplementary groups of
<I>username</I>.

This option is only useful when running as root and enables the
correct execution of setuid and/or setgid binaries.
Unless this option is used setuid and setgid programs are executed
without effective privileges.

<DT id="10"><B>-b </B><I>syscall</I>

<DD>

<B>--detach-on</B>=<B></B><I>syscall</I>

If specified syscall is reached, detach from traced process.
Currently, only
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+execve">execve</A></B>(2)

syscall is supported.  This option is useful if you want to trace
multi-threaded process and therefore require
<B>-f</B>,

but don't want to trace its (potentially very complex) children.
<DT id="11"><B>-D</B>

<DD>
Run tracer process as a grandchild, not as the parent of the
tracee.  This reduces the visible effect of
<B>strace</B>

by keeping the tracee a direct child of the calling process.
<DT id="12"><B>-DD</B>

<DD>
Run tracer process as tracee's grandchild in a separate process group.
In addition to reduction of the visible effect of
<B>strace</B>,

it also avoids killing of
<B>strace</B>

with
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+kill">kill</A></B>(2)

issued to the whole process group.
<DT id="13"><B>-DDD</B>

<DD>
Run tracer process as tracee's grandchild in a separate session
(&quot;true daemonisation&quot;).
In addition to reduction of the visible effect of
<B>strace</B>,

it also avoids killing of
<B>strace</B>

upon session termination.
<DT id="14"><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced
processes as a result of the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+fork">fork</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+vfork">vfork</A></B>(2)

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+clone">clone</A></B>(2)

system calls.  Note that
<B>-p</B>

<I>PID</I>

<B>-f</B>

will attach all threads of process
<I>PID</I>

if it is multi-threaded, not only thread with
<I>thread_id</I> = <I>PID</I>.

<DT id="15"><B>-ff</B>

<DD>
If the
<B>-o</B>

<I>filename</I>

option is in effect, each processes trace is written to
<I>filename</I>.<I>pid</I>

where
<I>pid</I>

is the numeric process id of each process.
This is incompatible with
<B>-c</B>,

since no per-process counts are kept.
<DT id="16"><DD>
One might want to consider using
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+strace-log-merge">strace-log-merge</A></B>(1)

to obtain a combined strace log view.

which is useful to seeing what files the process is referencing.
Furthermore, using the abbreviation will ensure that you don't

The
<B>-c</B>

option is useful for determining which system calls might be useful
to trace.  For example,
<B>trace</B>=<B>open,close,read,write</B>

means to only
trace those four system calls.  Be careful when making inferences
about the user/kernel boundary if only a subset of system calls
are being monitored.  The default is
<B>trace</B>=<B>all</B>.

<DT id="45"><B>-e&nbsp;signal</B>=,<I>set</I><DD>

<B>--signal</B>=,<I>set</I>
Trace only the specified subset of signals.  The default is
<B>signal</B>=<B>all</B>.

For example,
<B>signal</B>=!<B>SIGIO</B>

(or
<B>signal</B>=!<B>io</B>)

causes
<B>SIGIO</B>

signals not to be traced.
<DT id="46"><B>-e&nbsp;status</B>=,<I>set</I><DD>

<B>--status</B>=,<I>set</I>
Print only system calls with the specified return status.  The default is
<B>status</B>=<B>all</B>.

<DT id="55"><B>-e&nbsp;raw</B>=,<I>syscall_set</I><DD>

<B>--raw</B>=,<I>syscall_set</I>
Print raw, undecoded arguments for the specified set of system calls.
The syntax of the
<I>syscall_set</I>

specification is the same as in the
<B>-e trace</B>

option.
This option has the effect of causing all arguments to be printed
in hexadecimal.  This is mostly useful if you don't trust the
decoding or you need to know the actual numeric value of an
argument.
See also
<B>-X raw</B>

option.
<DT id="56"><B>-e&nbsp;read</B>=,<I>set</I><DD>

<B>--read</B>=,<I>set</I>
Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all the data read from
file descriptors listed in the specified set.  For example, to see
all input activity on file descriptors
<I>3</I>

and
<I>5</I>

use
<B>-e&nbsp;read</B>=,<I>3</I>,<I>5</I>.
Note that this is independent from the normal tracing of the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+read">read</A></B>(2)

all output activity on file descriptors
<I>3</I>

and
<I>5</I>

use
<B>-e&nbsp;write</B>=,<I>3</I>,,<I>5</I>.
Note that this is independent from the normal tracing of the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+write">write</A></B>(2)

Print the execution stack trace of the traced
processes after each system call.
<DT id="61"><B>-o </B><I>filename</I>

<DD>

<B>--output</B>=<B></B><I>filename</I>

Write the trace output to the file
<I>filename</I>

rather than to stderr.
<I>filename</I>.<I>pid</I>

form is used if
<B>-ff</B>

option is supplied.
If the argument begins with '|' or '!', the rest of the
argument is treated as a command and all output is piped to it.
This is convenient for piping the debugging output to a program
without affecting the redirections of executed programs.
The latter is not compatible with
<B>-ff</B>

option currently.
<DT id="62"><B>-A</B>

<DD>

<B>--output-append-mode</B>

Open the file provided in the
<B>-o</B>

option in append mode.
<DT id="63"><B>-q</B>

<DD>
Suppress messages about attaching, detaching etc.  This happens
automatically when output is redirected to a file and the command
is run directly instead of attaching.
<DT id="64"><B>-qq</B>

<DD>
If given twice, suppress messages about process exit status.
<DT id="65"><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call.  This
records the time difference between the beginning of successive
system calls.
Note that since
<B>-r</B>

option uses the monotonic clock time for measuring time difference and not the
wall clock time, its measurements can differ from the difference in time
reported by the
<B>-t</B>

option.
<DT id="66"><B>-s </B><I>strsize</I>

<DD>

<B>--string-limit</B>=<B></B><I>strsize</I>

Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32).  Note
that filenames are not considered strings and are always printed in
full.
<DT id="67"><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Prefix each line of the trace with the wall clock time.
<DT id="68"><B>-tt</B>

<DD>
If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.
<DT id="69"><B>-ttt</B>

<DD>
If given thrice, the time printed will include the microseconds
and the leading portion will be printed as the number
of seconds since the epoch.
<DT id="70"><B>-T</B>

<DD>
Show the time spent in system calls.  This records the time
difference between the beginning and the end of each system call.
<DT id="71"><B>-v</B>

<DD>

<B>--no-abbrev</B>

Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat, termios, etc.
calls.  These structures are very common in calls and so the default
behavior displays a reasonable subset of structure members.  Use
this option to get all of the gory details.
<DT id="72"><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string format.
<DT id="73"><B>-xx</B>

<DD>
Print all strings in hexadecimal string format.
<DT id="74"><B>-X </B><I>format</I>

<DD>

<B>--const-print-style</B>=<B></B><I>format</I>

Set the format for printing of named constants and flags.
Supported

<DL COMPACT><DT id="75"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="76"><B>raw</B>

<DD>
Raw number output, without decoding.

<B>abbrev</B>

Output a named constant or a set of flags instead of the raw number if they are
found.
This is the default
<B>strace</B>

behaviour.

<B>verbose</B>

Output both the raw value and the decoded string (as a comment).
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="77"><B>-y</B>

<DT id="79"><B>-c</B>

<DD>

<B>--summary-only</B>

Count time, calls, and errors for each system call and report a summary on
program exit, suppressing the regular output.
This attempts to show system time (CPU time spent running
in the kernel) independent of wall clock time.  If
<B>-c</B>

is used with
<B>-f</B>,

only aggregate totals for all traced processes are kept.
<DT id="80"><B>-C</B>

<DD>

<B>--summary</B>

Like
<B>-c</B>

but also print regular output while processes are running.
<DT id="81"><B>-O </B><I>overhead</I>

<DD>
Set the overhead for tracing system calls to
<I>overhead</I>.

This is useful for overriding the default heuristic for guessing
how much time is spent in mere measuring when timing system calls using
the
<B>-c</B>

option.  The accuracy of the heuristic can be gauged by timing a given
program run without tracing (using
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+time">time</A></B>(1))

and comparing the accumulated
system call time to the total produced using
<B>-c</B>.

<I>Time specification format description.</I>

<DT id="83"><B>-S </B><I>sortby</I>

<B>--summary-sort-by</B>=<B></B><I>sortby</I>

Sort the output of the histogram printed by the

option by the specified criterion.  Legal values are
<B>time</B> (or <B>time_total</B> or <B>total_time</B>),

<B>calls</B> (or <B>count</B>),

<B>errors</B> (or <B>error</B>),

<B>name</B> (or <B>syscall</B> or <B>syscall_name</B>),

and
<B>nothing</B> (or <B>none</B>);

default is
<B>time</B>.

<DT id="84"><B>-w</B>

<DD>

<B>--summary-wall-clock</B>

Summarise the time difference between the beginning and end of
each system call.  The default is to summarise the system time.

Perform syscall tampering for the specified set of syscalls.
The syntax of the
<I>syscall_set</I>

specification is the same as in the
<B>-e trace</B>

option.
<DT id="86"><DD>
At least one of

<B>error</B>

and
<B>retval</B>

are mutually exclusive.
<DT id="87"><DD>
If :<B>error</B>=,<I>errno/</I> option is specified,
a fault is injected into a syscall invocation:
the syscall number is replaced by -1 which corresponds to an invalid syscall
(unless a syscall is specified with :<B>syscall=</B> option),
and the error code is specified using a symbolic
<I>errno</I>

value like
<B>ENOSYS</B>

or a numeric value within 1..4095 range.
<DT id="88"><DD>
If :<B>retval</B>=,<I>value/</I> option is specified,
success injection is performed: the syscall number is replaced by -1,
but a bogus success value is returned to the callee.
<DT id="89"><DD>
If :<B>signal</B>=,<I>sig/</I> option is specified with either a symbolic value
like
<B>SIGSEGV</B>

or a numeric value within 1..<B>SIGRTMAX</B> range,

<DT id="90"><DD>
If :<B>delay_enter</B>=,<I>delay/</I> or :<B>delay_exit</B>=,<I>delay/</I>

by time period specified by
<I>delay</I>

on entering or exiting the syscall, respectively.
The format of
<I>delay</I>

specification is described in section
<I>Time specification format description.</I>

<DT id="91"><DD>
If :<B>signal</B>=,<I>sig/</I> option is specified without
:<B>error</B>=,<I>errno/</I>, :<B>retval</B>=,<I>value/</I> or
:<B>delay_{enter,exit}</B>=,<I>usecs/</I> options,
then only a signal
<I>sig</I>

is delivered without a syscall fault or delay injection.
Conversely, :<B>error</B>=,<I>errno/</I> or
:<B>retval</B>=,<I>value/</I> option without
:<B>delay_enter</B>=,<I>delay/</I>,
:<B>delay_exit</B>=,<I>delay/</I> or
:<B>signal</B>=,<I>sig/</I> options injects a fault without delivering a signal

<DT id="92"><DD>
If both :<B>error</B>=,<I>errno/</I> or :<B>retval</B>=,<I>value/</I>
and :<B>signal</B>=,<I>sig/</I> options are specified, then both
a fault or success is injected and a signal is delivered.
<DT id="93"><DD>
if :<B>syscall</B>=<I>syscall</I> option is specified, the corresponding syscall
with no side effects is injected instead of -1.
Currently, only &quot;pure&quot; (see
<B>-e trace</B>=<B>%pure</B>

description) syscalls can be specified there.
<DT id="94"><DD>
Unless a :<B>when</B>=,<I>expr</I> subexpression is specified,
an injection is being made into every invocation of each syscall from the

exits with the same exit status.
If

<H2>SETUID INSTALLATION</H2>

If
<B>strace</B>

is installed setuid to root then the invoking user will be able to
attach to and trace processes owned by any user.
In addition setuid and setgid programs will be executed and traced
with the correct effective privileges.
Since only users trusted with full root privileges should be allowed
to do these things,
it only makes sense to install
<B>strace</B>

as setuid to root when the users who can execute it are restricted
to those users who have this trust.
For example, it makes sense to install a special version of
<B>strace</B>

with mode 'rwsr-xr--', user
<B>root</B>

and group
<B>trace</B>,

where members of the
<B>trace</B>

group are trusted users.
If you do use this feature, please remember to install
a regular non-setuid version of
<B>strace</B>

for ordinary users to use.

<B>mx32-mpers</B>

nor
<B>no-mx32-mpers</B>,

then decoding of non-native 32-on-64-bit binaries is not implemented at all
or not applicable.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is produced by systems
employing shared libraries.
<P>

It is instructive to think about system call inputs and outputs
as data-flow across the user/kernel boundary.  Because user-space
and kernel-space are separate and address-protected, it is
sometimes possible to make deductive inferences about process
behavior using inputs and outputs as propositions.
<P>

In some cases, a system call will differ from the documented behavior
or have a different name.  For example, the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+faccessat">faccessat</A></B>(2)

system call does not have
<I>flags</I>

argument, and the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+setrlimit">setrlimit</A></B>(2)

library function uses
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+prlimit64">prlimit64</A></B>(2)

system call on modern (2.6.38+) kernels.  These
discrepancies are normal but idiosyncratic characteristics of the
system call interface and are accounted for by C library wrapper
functions.
<P>

Some system calls have different names in different architectures and
personalities.  In these cases, system call filtering and printing
uses the names that match corresponding
<B>__NR_</B>*

kernel macros of the tracee's architecture and personality.
There are two exceptions from this general rule:
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+arm_fadvise64_64">arm_fadvise64_64</A></B>(2)

ARM syscall and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+xtensa_fadvise64_64">xtensa_fadvise64_64</A></B>(2)

Xtensa syscall are filtered and printed as
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+fadvise64_64">fadvise64_64</A></B>(2).

<P>

On x32, syscalls that are intended to be used by 64-bit processes and not x32
ones (for example,
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+readv">readv</A></B>(2),

that has syscall number 19 on x86_64, with its x32 counterpart has syscall
number 515), but called with
<B>__X32_SYSCALL_BIT</B>

flag being set, are designated with
<B>#64</B>

suffix.
<P>

On some platforms a process that is attached to with the
<B>-p</B>

option may observe a spurious
<B>EINTR</B>

return from the current system call that is not restartable.
(Ideally, all system calls should be restarted on
<B>strace</B>

attach, making the attach invisible
to the traced process, but a few system calls aren't.
Arguably, every instance of such behavior is a kernel bug.)
This may have an unpredictable effect on the process
if the process takes no action to restart the system call.
<P>

As
<B>strace</B>

executes the specified
<I>command</I>

directly and does not employ a shell for that, scripts without shebang
that usually run just fine when invoked by shell fail to execute with
<B>ENOEXEC</B>

error.
It is advisable to manually supply a shell as a
<I>command</I>

with the script as its argument.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Programs that use the
<I>setuid</I>

bit do not have
effective user
<FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT>
privileges while being traced.
<P>

A traced process runs slowly.
<P>

Traced processes which are descended from
<I>command</I>

may be left running after an interrupt signal
(<B>CTRL-C</B>).

<H2>HISTORY</H2>

The original
<B>strace</B>

was written by Paul Kranenburg
for SunOS and was inspired by its
<B>trace</B>

utility.
The SunOS version of
<B>strace</B>

was ported to Linux and enhanced
by Branko Lankester, who also wrote the Linux kernel support.
Even though Paul released
<B>strace</B>

2.5 in 1992,
Branko's work was based on Paul's
<B>strace</B>

1.5 release from 1991.
In 1993, Rick Sladkey merged
<B>strace</B>

2.5 for SunOS and the second release of
<B>strace</B>

for Linux, added many of the features of
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+truss">truss</A></B>(1)

from SVR4, and produced an
<B>strace</B>

that worked on both platforms.  In 1994 Rick ported
<B>strace</B>

to SVR4 and Solaris and wrote the
automatic configuration support.  In 1995 he ported
<B>strace</B>

to Irix
and tired of writing about himself in the third person.
<P>

Beginning with 1996,
<B>strace</B>

was maintained by Wichert Akkerman.
During his tenure,
<B>strace</B>

development migrated to CVS; ports to FreeBSD and many architectures on Linux
(including ARM, IA-64, MIPS, PA-RISC, PowerPC, s390, SPARC) were introduced.
In 2002, the burden of
<B>strace</B>

maintainership was transferred to Roland McGrath.
Since then,
<B>strace</B>

gained support for several new Linux architectures (AMD64, s390x, SuperH),
bi-architecture support for some of them, and received numerous additions and
improvements in syscalls decoders on Linux;
<B>strace</B>

development migrated to
<B>git</B>

during that period.
Since 2009,
<B>strace</B>

is actively maintained by Dmitry Levin.
<B>strace</B>

gained support for AArch64, ARC, AVR32, Blackfin, Meta, Nios II, OpenSISC 1000,
RISC-V, Tile/TileGx, Xtensa architectures since that time.
In 2012, unmaintained and apparently broken support for non-Linux operating
systems was removed.
Also, in 2012
<B>strace</B>

gained support for path tracing and file descriptor path decoding.
In 2014, support for stack traces printing was added.
In 2016, syscall fault injection was implemented.
