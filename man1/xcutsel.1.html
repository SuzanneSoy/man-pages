xcutsel - interchange between cut buffer and selection
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>xcutsel</B> [ <I>-toolkitoption</I> ...] [-selection <I>selection</I>] [-cutbuffer <I>number</I>]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <I>xcutsel</I> program is used to copy the current selection into a
cut buffer and to make a selection that contains the current contents of
the cut buffer.  It acts as a bridge between applications that don't support
selections and those that do.
<P>

By default, <I>xcutsel</I> will use the selection named PRIMARY and the cut
buffer CUT_BUFFER0.  Either or both of these can be overridden by command
line arguments or by resources.
<P>

An <I>xcutsel</I> window has the following buttons:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><I>    quit</I>

<DD>
When this button is pressed, <I>xcutsel</I> exits.  Any selections held by
<I>xcutsel</I> are automatically released.
<DT id="2"><I>    copy PRIMARY to 0</I>

<DD>
When this button is pressed, <I>xcutsel</I> copies the current selection into
the cut buffer.
<DT id="3"><I>    copy 0 to PRIMARY</I>

<DD>
When this button is pressed, <I>xcutsel</I> converts the current contents of
the cut buffer into the selection.
</DL>
<P>

The button labels reflect the selection and cutbuffer selected by
command line options or through the resource database.
<P>

When the ``copy 0 to PRIMARY'' button is activated, the button will
remain inverted as long as <I>xcutsel</I> remains the owner of the
selection.  This serves to remind you which client owns the current
selection.  Note that the value of the selection remains constant;
if the cutbuffer is changed, you must again activate the copy button
to retrieve the new value when desired.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<I>Xcutsel</I>

accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options as well as the
following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4"><B>-selection </B><I>name</I>

<DD>
This option specifies the name of the selection to use.  The default is
PRIMARY.  The only supported abbreviations for this option are ``-select'',
``-sel'' and ``-s'', as the standard toolkit option ``-selectionTimeout'' has a
similar name.
<DT id="5"><B>-cutbuffer </B><I>number</I>

<DD>
This option specifies the cut buffer to use.  The default is cut buffer 0.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>

PRIMARY.
<DT id="7"><B>cutBuffer (</B>class<B> CutBuffer)</B>
