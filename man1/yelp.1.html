The GNOME Help Browser includes detailed documentation 
for the majority of applications, utilities and other 
components, such as the panel or the Nautilus file manager. 
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>

Yelp can display some HTML and XML files when passed 
on the command-line, but it's primarily called from 
applications. 
<P>

You can also start Yelp by choosing Desktop-&gt;Help. 
This will show the top-level help system page, listing all 
GNOME documents conveniently organized by topic. 
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS </H2>

<P>

This program accepts all the standard GNOME 
and GTK+ options, which follow 
the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting 
with two dashes (`-'). To get more information about these 
options launch Yelp with the `--help' argument.
