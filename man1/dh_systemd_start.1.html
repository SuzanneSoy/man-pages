dh_systemd_start - start/stop/restart systemd unit files
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>



<B>dh_systemd_start</B> [<I>debhelper options</I>] [<B>--restart-after-upgrade</B>] [<B>--no-stop-on-upgrade</B>] [<I>unit file</I> ...]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



<B>dh_systemd_start</B> is a debhelper program that is responsible for
starting/stopping or restarting systemd unit files in case no corresponding
sysv init script is available.
<P>

As with <B>dh_installinit</B>, the unit file is stopped before
upgrades and started afterwards (unless <B>--restart-after-upgrade</B> is
specified, in which case it will only be restarted after the upgrade).
This logic is not used when there is a corresponding SysV init script
because invoke-rc.d performs the stop/start/restart in that case.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>--restart-after-upgrade</B><DD>


Do not stop the unit file until after the package upgrade has been completed.
This is the default behaviour in compat 10.


<P>


In earlier compat levels the default was to stop the unit file in the
<I>prerm</I>, and start it again in the <I>postinst</I>.


<P>


This can be useful for daemons that should not have a possibly long
downtime during upgrade. But you should make sure that the daemon will not
get confused by the package being upgraded while it's running before using
this option.
<DT id="2"><B>--no-restart-after-upgrade</B><DD>


Undo a previous <B>--restart-after-upgrade</B> (or the default of compat
10).  If no other options are given, this will cause the service to be
stopped in the <I>prerm</I> script and started again in the <I>postinst</I>
script.
<DT id="3"><B>-r</B>, <B>--no-stop-on-upgrade</B>, <B>--no-restart-on-upgrade</B><DD>


Do not stop service on upgrade.
<DT id="4"><B>--no-start</B><DD>


Do not start the unit file after upgrades and after initial installation (the
latter is only relevant for services without a corresponding init script).

<H2>NOTES</H2>



Note that this command is not idempotent. <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dh_prep">dh_prep</A></B>(1) should be called
between invocations of this command (with the same arguments). Otherwise, it
may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer
scripts.
<P>

Note that <B>dh_systemd_start</B> should be run after <B>dh_installinit</B> so that it
can detect corresponding SysV init scripts. The default sequence in <B>dh</B> does
the right thing, this note is only relevant when you are calling
<B>dh_systemd_start</B> manually.
