min12xxw - Convert pbmraw streams to Minolta PagePro 12xxW languages
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
min12xxw [options]

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>Min12xxw</B>

is a filter which converts pbmraw streams (produced by ghostscript,
for example) to the printer language of Minolta PagePro 1[234]xxW
printers.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>-h, --help</B>

<DD>
Gives usage information (help)
<P>
<DT id="2"><B>-v, --version</B>

<DD>
Displays the version number and exit
<P>
<DT id="3"><B>-e, --ecomode</B>

<DD>
Enables economic mode which saves toner by leaving every other scanline
blank. This degrades the printout's resolution a little, the effect is
most easily seen (and looks particularly bad) when printing in 300 dpi
mode.
<P>
<DT id="4"><B>-s, --status</B>

<DD>
Query the printer status, page counter and whatever information can be
retrieved. The printer status is basically an unprocessed dump of what
the printer sends, so unexpected things may happen if the printer sends
funny data because it got confused somehow... This might however still
be useful. The page counter and other information is heavily processed
and should be more reliable. Note that for queries to be made, the
printer must (of course) be switched on, with all cables connected, and
not be busy printing (or your print job may be truncated). See the
<B>-d</B>

option below which sets the device file to use. This has so far only been
tested on 1200W, 1350W and 1400W printers. Send mail if it works for
others as well.
<P>
<DT id="5"><B>-d dev, --device dev</B>

<DD>
Sets the device file to use for queries. The default is /dev/lp0.
<P>
Please note that this option is only meaningful with the &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;--status&quot;
option. If you intend to send a document to the printer, you have to
redirect min12xxw's standard output to the device file in question. See
the documentation that came with your shell on how to do that.
<P>
<DT id="6"><B>-n, --nomargins</B>

<DD>
Disables the enforcement of the 0.17 inch margins on all sides of the
paper. The converter discards the equivalent of this length of its input
because ghostscript outputs a full page with margins. If you arranged in
some way for the input to be marginless, or have slightly larger paper,
you can give this option to include the full input with margins. Please
note that for very small page dimensions, min12xxw might need to disable
enforcing the page margins for all pages following the offending page to
make the job printable. In that case, a warning message will be printed
on the standard error stream to inform the user.
<P>
<DT id="7"><B>-m model, --model model</B>

<DD>
Sets which printer model to produce output for. Currently, no checks for
features only available to specific models are made (available paper trays
differ from model to model, for example). Let me know if this causes
problems. Available models are: 1200W, 1250W, 1300W, 1350W, 1400W. 1200W
is the default. As an alternative, you can also symlink, link or rename
your executable to min1200w, min1250w, min1300w, min1350w or min1400w,
thus making the model specified in the filename the default model. This
saves you from typing the model selection option again and again and
again...
Please note that you
<B>must</B>

supply the model option correctly if you drive any other model than what
is the default. If you fail to do so, your printer will not produce any
output or react to status queries from the host.
<P>
<DT id="8"><B>-r resolution, --res resolution</B>

<DD>
Sets the resolution to either 300, 600 or 1200 dpi (600 dpi is the
default). Keep in mind that you need to produce your output
accordingly. It is also possible to specify the resolution as
(horizontal)x(vertical) resolution (e.g. -r 1200x600) where horizontal
resolution may be once or twice the vertical resolution. The maximum
resolution is 1200 dpi in both vertical and horizontal direction. The
minimum vertical resolution for mixed resolution printing seems to be
600 dpi. 300 dpi printing has only been tested on 1200W, 1350W and 1400W
models. Mixed resolution printing was seen for 13xxW and 1400W models
only, but tests show that the 1200W is capable of handling it as well,
so chances are that 1250W printers won't have trouble, either.
<P>
<DT id="9"><B>-t tray, --tray tray</B>

<DD>
Sets the paper tray to be used. Valid values for tray are &quot;auto&quot;,
&quot;tray1&quot;, &quot;tray2&quot; and &quot;manual&quot;, with &quot;auto&quot; being the default. Not all
printer models have all sorts of paper trays. &quot;auto&quot; should be safe on
all of them, I think. In fact, the PagePro 1400W seems to have only this
kind of paper tray.
<P>
<DT id="10"><B>-p type, --papertype type</B>

<DD>
Sets the type of paper used. Type can be one of &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;thick&quot;,
&quot;transparency&quot;, &quot;envelope&quot; or &quot;postcard&quot;. &quot;normal&quot; is the default.
<P>
<DT id="11"><B>-f fmt, --paperformat fmt</B>

<DD>
This sets the paper format to be used for the print job. The default
value for fmt is &quot;a4&quot;. Valid values are given below.

<DD>
This would convert a postscript file test.ps to a file test.min which
could be sent directly to the printer, a 1200W to be exact. The output is
rendered at 1200 dpi. If you have to drive some other model, see the model
selection option (-m) above.

should run on most *nix-like workstations without major problems. Library
functions which are known to be missing on non-Linux systems such as
getline or getopt_long may have to be replaced by an appropriate substitute.
In case of getline and getopt_long this has already been done. The query
options may or may not work on other systems, depending on the characteristics
of the printer driver and the interface used (USB, very old style
parallel port or a more recent one...).

<B>Min12xxw</B>

was written without any documentation from the
manufacturer. The description of the printer language may be
inaccurate or even wrong because it was obtained by looking at the
output of the windoof driver only. The code dealing with the
compression of raster data is in its spirit heavily based on an
initial driver by Adam Bocim &lt;<A HREF="mailto:beetman@seznam.cz">beetman@seznam.cz</A>&gt; who managed to
find out how things are done (thanks, Adam, you did a great job!).
This new version is considerably faster, implemented more cleanly
and (hopefully) well documented.
<P>
It also features querying the printer status and page counter, a
suggestion made by Bruno Schoedlbauer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bruno.schoedlbauer@gmx.de">bruno.schoedlbauer@gmx.de</A>&gt;,
who also pointed me to a nice USB sniffer by Benoit Papillault for
Windoof 98 and up, see <A HREF="http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop.">http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop.</A>
(That little program may prove very helpful on similar occasions.
Happy USB sniffing...)
<P>
David Hamilton &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dhamilto@angel.homeip.net">dhamilto@angel.homeip.net</A>&gt; has helped a lot in testing
and developing the support for the PagePro 1350W.
<P>
Even though this program has been designed with care and much thought,
no-one can guarantee that this program will not damage your printer,
computer or even your neighbour's car, because it was built without
knowing exactly how things work, it's only a (hopefully) reasonable
guess. (However, my printer does still work, even after the testing
phase when a lot of wrong stuff was sent to it. And my neighbour
hasn't complained either...)
<P>
Most of the available paper sizes have not actually been verified
to work as advertised - reports about successes or problems are welcome.
Also the code for querying the printer is not heavily tested. If you
have comments to make or know more about the format than I do, please
share your thoughts and your knowledge.
<P>
13xxW series support seems to be relatively well tested by now. Send mail
with feedback if you have such a printer and you experience problems.
<P>
1400W support is pretty new - please send e-mail if it works or if you
run into problems. Feedback on models for which support has just been
completed is very important to improve and stabilise this support.
<P>
Bugs and problems reports are generally welcome because I just don't
have the time to test everything out. I needed a filter and here it
is. If it does not work - complain ;-)
