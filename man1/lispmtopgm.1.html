lispmtopgm - convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file into pgm format
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>lispmtopgm</B>

[<I>lispmfile</I>]

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Reads a Lisp Machine bitmap as input.
<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
Produces a portable graymap as output.
<P>

This is the file format written by the tv:write-bit-array-file function on
TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp machines.
<P>

Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image file
format does not include a color map, so we must treat it as a graymap 
instead.  This is unfortunate.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

The Lispm bitmap file format is a bit quirky;  Usually the image in the file
has its width rounded up to the next higher multiple of 32, but not always.
If the width is not a multiple of 32, we don't deal with it properly, but 
because of the Lispm microcode, such arrays are probably not image data 
anyway.
<P>

Also, the lispm code for saving bitmaps has a bug, in that if you are writing a
bitmap which is not mod32 across, the file may be up to 7 bits too short!  They
round down instead of up, and we don't handle this bug gracefully.
<P>

No color.
