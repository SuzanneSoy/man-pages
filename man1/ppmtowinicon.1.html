<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Reads one or more portable pixmaps as input.
Produces a Microsoft Windows .ico file as output.
<P>
A Windows icon contains 1 or more images, at different resolutions
and color depths. 
<P>
Microsoft recommends including at least the following formats in each
icon (size and bits-per-pixel):
<P>

16 x 16 - 4 bpp
<P>

32 x 32 - 4 bpp
<P>

48 x 48 - 8 bpp
<P>

Default I/O is STDIN/STDOUT.

<DD>
If this option is given, every second file is read as an &quot;and mask&quot; to be
used by windows for transparency data for the previous image. (These are
set to fully opaque by default). The and mask is a PGM image, where any
pixel with maxval intensity means opaque and any other pixel means not
opaque. Note that as with all Netpbm programs, you may use a PBM file here
and it will be used as if it were the equivalent PGM.
<P>
The and mask is like an alpha mask, except for what it signifies in the
&quot;not opaque&quot; areas. In the usual case, the foreground image is black in
those areas, and in that case the areas are fully transparent -- the
background shows through the icon. But in general, a not opaque pixel
signifies that the background and foreground should be merged as follows:
The intensities of the color components in the forgeground and background
are represented as binary numbers, then corresponding bits of the
background and foreground intensities are exlusive-or'ed together. So there
is a sort of reverse video effect.

File to write.  By default, the icon is written to stdout.
