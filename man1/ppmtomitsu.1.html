<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Reads a portable pixmap as input and converts it into a format suitable
to be printed by a Mitsubishi S340-10 printer, or any other Mitsubishi
color sublimation printer.
<P>

The Mitsubishi S340-10 Color Sublimation printer supports 24bit color.
Images of the available sizes take so long to transfer that there is a
fast method, employing a lookuptable, that ppmtomitsu will use if there
is a maximum of 256 colors in the pixmap.
ppmtomitsu will try to position your image to the center of the paper,
and will rotate your image for you if xsize is larger than ysize.
If your image is larger than the media allows, ppmtomitsu will quit
with an error message. (We decided that the media were too expensive
to have careless users produce misprints.) 
Once data transmission has started, the job can't be stopped in a
sane way without resetting the printer.
The printer understands putting together images in the printers memory;
ppmtomitsu doesn't utilize this as pnmcat etc provide the same functionality
and let you view the result on-screen, too.
The S340-10 is the lowest common denominator printer; for higher
resolution printers there's the dpi300 option. The other printers also
support higher values for enlarge eg, but I don't think that's essential
enough to warrant a change in the program.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>-sharpness</B><I> 1-4</I>

<DD>
<BR>&nbsp;'sharpness'&nbsp;designation.&nbsp;Default&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;the&nbsp;current&nbsp;sharpness.
<DT id="2"><B>-enlarge</B><I> 1-3</I>

<DD>
Enlarge by a factor; Default is 1 (no enlarge)
<DT id="3"><B>-media</B><I> A, A4, AS, A4S</I>

<DD>
Designate the media you're using. Default is 1184 x 1350, which will fit
on any media. A is 1216 x 1350, A4 is 1184 x 1452, AS is 1216 x 1650 and 
A4S is 1184 x 1754. A warning: If you specify a different media than the
printer currently has, the printer will wait until you put in the correct
media or switch it off.
<DT id="4"><B>-copy</B><I> 1-9</I>

<DD>
The number of copies to produce. Default is 1.
<DT id="5"><B>-dpi300</B>

<DD>
Double the number of allowed pixels for a S3600-30 Printer in S340-10
compatibility mode. (The S3600-30 has 300 dpi).
<DT id="6"><B>-tiny</B>

<DD>
Memory-safing, but always slow. The printer will get the data line-by-line
in 24bit. It's probably a good idea to use this if your machine starts
paging a lot without this option.
