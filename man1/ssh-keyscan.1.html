<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>ssh-keyscan</B>


is a utility for gathering the public SSH host keys of a number of
hosts.
It was designed to aid in building and verifying
ssh_known_hosts

files,
the format of which is documented in
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+sshd">sshd</A>(8).


<B>ssh-keyscan</B>


provides a minimal interface suitable for use by shell and perl
scripts.
<P>

<B>ssh-keyscan</B>


uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as possible in
parallel, so it is very efficient.
The keys from a domain of 1,000
hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those
hosts are down or do not run
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+sshd">sshd</A>(8).


For scanning, one does not need
login access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the
scanning process involve any encryption.
<P>

The options are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT id="1"><B>-4</B>


<DD>
Force
<B>ssh-keyscan</B>


to use IPv4 addresses only.
<DT id="2"><B>-6</B>


<DD>
Force
<B>ssh-keyscan</B>


to use IPv6 addresses only.
<DT id="3"><B>-c</B>


<DD>
Request certificates from target hosts instead of plain keys.
<DT id="4"><B>-D</B>


<DD>
Print keys found as SSHFP DNS records.
The default is to print keys in a format usable as a
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+ssh">ssh</A>(1)


known_hosts

file.
<DT id="5"><B>-f </B><I>file</I>




<DD>
Read hosts or
``addrlist namelist''

pairs from
<I>file</I>

 
one per line.
If
`-'

is supplied instead of a filename,
<B>ssh-keyscan</B>


will read from the standard input.
Input is expected in the format:

<PRE>
1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4 name.my.domain,name,n.my.domain,n,1.2.3.4,1.2.4.4
</PRE>

<DT id="6"><B>-H</B>


<DD>
Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output.
Hashed names may be used normally by
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+ssh">ssh</A>(1)


and
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+sshd">sshd</A>(8),


but they do not reveal identifying information should the file's contents
be disclosed.
<DT id="7"><B>-p </B><I>port</I>




<DD>
Connect to
<I>port</I>

on the remote host.
<DT id="8"><B>-T </B><I>timeout</I>




<DD>
Set the timeout for connection attempts.
If
<I>timeout</I>

seconds have elapsed since a connection was initiated to a host or since the
last time anything was read from that host, the connection is
closed and the host in question considered unavailable.
The default is 5 seconds.
<DT id="9"><B>-t </B><I>type</I>




<DD>
Specify the type of the key to fetch from the scanned hosts.
The possible values are
``dsa''

 
``ecdsa''

 
``ed25519''

 
or
``rsa''

 
Multiple values may be specified by separating them with commas.
The default is to fetch
``rsa''

 
``ecdsa''

 
and
``ed25519''

keys.
<DT id="10"><B>-v</B>


<DD>
Verbose mode:
print debugging messages about progress.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using
<B>ssh-keyscan</B>


without verifying the keys, users will be vulnerable to
<I>man in the middle</I>

attacks.
On the other hand, if the security model allows such a risk,
<B>ssh-keyscan</B>


can help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or man in the middle
attacks which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts file was created.
