dh_install - install files into package build directories
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>



<B>dh_install</B> [<B>-X</B><I>item</I>] [<B>--autodest</B>] [<B>--sourcedir=</B><I>dir</I>] [<I>debhelper options</I>] [<I>file|dir</I> ... <I>destdir</I>]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



<B>dh_install</B> is a debhelper program that handles installing files into package
build directories. There are many <B>dh_install</B><I>*</I> commands that handle installing
specific types of files such as documentation, examples, man pages, and so on,
and they should be used when possible as they often have extra intelligence for
those particular tasks. <B>dh_install</B>, then, is useful for installing everything
else, for which no particular intelligence is needed. It is a replacement for
the old <B>dh_movefiles</B> command.
<P>

This program may be used in one of two ways. If you just have a file or two
that the upstream Makefile does not install for you, you can run <B>dh_install</B>
on them to move them into place. On the other hand, maybe you have a large
package that builds multiple binary packages. You can use the upstream
<I>Makefile</I> to install it all into <I>debian/tmp</I>, and then use <B>dh_install</B> to copy
directories and files from there into the proper package build directories.
<P>

From debhelper compatibility level 7 on, <B>dh_install</B> will fall back to
looking in <I>debian/tmp</I> for files, if it does not find them in the current
directory (or wherever you've told it to look using <B>--sourcedir</B>).

<H2>FILES</H2>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">debian/<I>package</I>.install<DD>


List the files to install into each package and the directory they should be
installed to. The format is a set of lines, where each line lists a file or
files to install, and at the end of the line tells the directory it should be
installed in. The name of the files (or directories) to install should be given
relative to the current directory, while the installation directory is given
relative to the package build directory. You may use wildcards in the names of
the files to install.


<P>


Note that if you list exactly one filename or wildcard-pattern on a line by
itself, with no explicit destination, then <B>dh_install</B>
will automatically guess the destination to use, the same as if the
--autodest option were used.


<P>


Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
documented in <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+debhelper">debhelper</A></B>(7).
<DT id="2">debian/not-installed<DD>


Used with the deprecated <B>--list-missing</B> and <B>--fail-missing</B> options.
Please refer to <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dh_missing">dh_missing</A></B>(1) for the documentation of this file.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3"><B>--list-missing</B><DD>


<B>Deprecated</B>: Please use <B>dh_missing --list-missing</B> instead.  If you use
this option, <B>dh_install</B> will call <B>dh_missing</B> with that option after it has
processed all the files.  Please see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dh_missing">dh_missing</A></B>(1) for the documentation of
this option.


<P>


This option is removed in compat 12.
<DT id="4"><B>--fail-missing</B><DD>


<B>Deprecated</B>: Please use <B>dh_missing --fail-missing</B> instead.  If you use
this option, <B>dh_install</B> will call <B>dh_missing</B> with that option after it has
processed all the files.  Please see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dh_missing">dh_missing</A></B>(1) for the documentation of
this option.


<P>


This option is removed in compat 12.
<DT id="5"><B>--sourcedir=</B><I>dir</I><DD>


Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.


<P>


Note that this is not the same as the <B>--sourcedirectory</B> option used
by the <B>dh_auto_</B><I>*</I> commands. You rarely need to use this option, since
<B>dh_install</B> automatically looks for files in <I>debian/tmp</I> in debhelper
compatibility level 7 and above.
<DT id="6"><B>--autodest</B><DD>


Guess as the destination directory to install things to. If this is
specified, you should not list destination directories in
<I>debian/package.install</I> files or on the command line. Instead, <B>dh_install</B>
will guess as follows:


<P>


Strip off <I>debian/tmp</I> (or the sourcedir if one is given) from the front of
the filename, if it is present, and install into the dirname of the
filename. So if the filename is <I>debian/tmp/usr/bin</I>, then that directory
will be copied to <I>debian/package/usr/</I>. If the filename is
<I>debian/tmp/etc/passwd</I>, it will be copied to <I>debian/package/etc/</I>.
<DT id="7"><I>file|dir</I> ... <I>destdir</I><DD>


Lists files (or directories) to install and where to install them to.
The files will be installed into the first package <I>dh_install</I> acts on.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>



Here are some small examples of configuration files for dh_install.
<P>



<PRE>
    # Install my-prog into usr/bin (as &quot;usr/bin/my-prog&quot;)
    my-prog usr/bin

    # Install a plugins directory into usr/share/my-prog
    # (as &quot;usr/share/my-prog/plugins/&quot;)
    plugins usr/share/my-prog

    # Install a file with spaces in into usr/share/my-prog/data
    # (as &quot;usr/share/my-prog/data/my datafile with spaces.txt&quot;)
    # ASSUMES COMPAT 13, where substitution patterns are available
    my${Space}datafile${Space}with${Space}spaces.txt usr/share/my-prog/data

    # Install a library into the multi-arch lib directory
    # ASSUMES COMPAT 13, where substitution patterns are available
    build/output/libfrop*.so.* usr/lib/${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH}

<H2>LIMITATIONS</H2>



<B>dh_install</B> cannot rename files or directories, it can only install them
with the names they already have into wherever you want in the package
build tree.
<P>

However, renaming can be achieved by using <B>dh-exec</B> with compatibility level 9 or
later.  An example debian/<I>package</I>.install file using <B>dh-exec</B>
could look like:
<P>



<PRE>
 #!/usr/bin/dh-exec
 debian/default.conf =&gt; /etc/my-package/start.conf

</PRE>


<P>

Please remember the following three things:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="8">&bull;<DD>
The package must be using compatibility level 9 or later (see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+debhelper">debhelper</A></B>(7))
<DT id="9">&bull;<DD>
The package will need a build-dependency on dh-exec.
<DT id="10">&bull;<DD>
The install file must be marked as executable.
