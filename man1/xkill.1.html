xkill - kill a client by its X resource
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>xkill</B>

[-display <I>displayname</I>] [-id <I>resource</I>] [-button number] [-frame] [-all] [-version]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<I>Xkill</I>

is a utility for forcing the X server to close connections to clients.  This
program is very dangerous, but is useful for aborting programs that have
displayed undesired windows on a user's screen.  If no resource identifier
is given with <I>-id</I>, <I>xkill</I> will display a special cursor
as a prompt for the user to select a window to be killed.  If a pointer button
is pressed over a non-root window, the server will close its connection to
the client that created the window.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>-display </B><I>displayname</I>

<DD>
This option specifies the name of the X server to contact.
<DT id="2"><B>-id </B><I>resource</I>

<DD>
This option specifies the X identifier for the resource whose creator is
to be aborted.  If no resource is specified, <I>xkill</I> will display a
special cursor with which you should select a window to be kill.
<DT id="3"><B>-button </B><I>number</I>

<DD>
This option specifies the number of pointer button
that should be used in selecting a window to kill.
If the word &quot;any&quot; is specified, any button on the pointer may be used.  By
default, the first button in the pointer map (which is usually the leftmost
button) is used.
<DT id="4"><B>-all</B>

<DD>
This option indicates that all clients with top-level windows on the screen
should be killed.  <I>Xkill</I> will ask you to select the root window with
each of the currently defined buttons to give you several chances to abort.
Use of this option is highly discouraged.
<DT id="5"><B>-frame</B>

<DD>
This option indicates that xkill should ignore the standard conventions for
finding top-level client windows (which are typically nested inside a window
manager window), and simply believe that you want to kill direct children of
the root.
<DT id="6"><B>-version</B>

<DD>
This option makes xkill print its version and exit without killing anything.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CAVEATS</H2>

This command does not provide any warranty that the application whose
connection to the X server is closed will abort nicely, or even abort
at all. All this command does is to close the connection to the X
server. Many existing applications do indeed abort when their
connection to the X server is closed, but some can choose to
continue.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>XDEFAULTS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="7"><B>Button</B>

<DD>
Specifies a specific pointer button number or the word &quot;any&quot; to use when
selecting windows.
