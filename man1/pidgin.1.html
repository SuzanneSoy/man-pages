<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>pidgin</B> is a graphical modular messaging client based on libpurple
which is capable of connecting to AIM, XMPP, ICQ, IRC, SILC,
Novell GroupWise, Lotus Sametime, Zephyr, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at once. It has
many common features found in other clients, as well as many unique features.
Pidgin is not endorsed by or affiliated with America Online, ICQ, or Microsoft.
<P>

Pidgin can be extended by plugins written in multiple programming languages and
controlled through DBus or <B>purple-remote</B>.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>

<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TERMS</H2>

Pidgin uses a few terms differently from other applications.  For convenience
they are defined here:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="10"><B>Buddy List</B>

<DD>
The list of other users who the user wants to see status information for
and have quick access to for messaging.
<DT id="11"><B>Buddy</B>

<DD>
A user who has been added to the Buddy List.
<DT id="12"><B>Contact</B>

<DD>
A grouping of more than one buddy who are all the same person.  A contact may
contain buddies from any protocol and may contain as many buddies as the user
desires.  Contact arrangements are stored locally only.
<DT id="13"><B>Alias</B>

<DD>
A private &quot;nickname&quot; that may be set for Buddies or the user himself.  On some
protocols, aliases are saved on the server but not visible to other users.  On
other protocols, aliases are saved only locally.
<DT id="14"><B>Protocol</B>

<DD>
A messaging service.  AIM, XMPP, Zephyr, etc. are protocols.  Others may
call these &quot;service types,&quot; &quot;account types,&quot; &quot;services,&quot; and so on.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUDDY LIST</H2>

The <B>Buddy List</B> window is Pidgin's main interface window.  Using
this window a user can see which of his/her buddies is online, away, idle,
etc.  The user can also add buddies to and remove buddies from the buddy list.
<P>
The <B>Buddy List</B> window contains a list of the user's buddies who are
online and have allowed the user to be notified of their presence.  The icon
to the left of each buddy indicates the buddy's current status.  Double
clicking a buddy will open a new <B>Conversation</B> window.  Right clicking
will pop up a menu:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="15"><B>Get Info</B>

<DD>
Retrieves and displays information about the buddy.  This information is
also known as a Profile.
<DT id="16"><B>IM</B>

<DD>
Opens a new <B>Conversation</B> window to the selected buddy.
<DT id="17"><B>Send File</B>

<DD>
Sends a file to the selected buddy (only available on protocols that support
file transfer).
<DT id="18"><B>Add Buddy Pounce</B>

<DD>
A Buddy Pounce is a configurable automated action to be performed when the
buddy's state changes.  This will open the <B>Buddy Pounce</B> dialog, which
will be discussed later.
<DT id="19"><B>View Log</B>

<DD>
Pidgin is capable of automatically logging messages.  These logs are
either plain text files (with a .txt extension) or html files (with a
.html extension) located under the <I>~/.purple/logs</I> directory.  This
menu command will display Pidgin's log viewer with logs loaded for that
buddy or chat.
<DT id="20"><B>Alias</B>

<DD>
Create an alias for this buddy.  This will show an editable text field where
the buddy's name was displayed.  In this field one can give this
buddy an alternate, more friendly name to appear on the buddy list and in
conversations.
<P>
For example, if a buddy's name was jsmith1281xx and his real
name was 'John Q. Smith,' one could create an alias as to identify the
buddy by his common name.
</DL>
<P>

The remainder of the menu will consist of protocol specific commands.
These commands vary depending on the protocol.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="21"><B>Status Selector</B>

<DD>
At the bottom of the <B>Buddy List</B> is a status selector which allows one to
change his/her status.  This will be discussed further in the <B>STATUS
MESSAGES</B> section below.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ACCOUNT EDITOR</H2>

The account editor consists of a list of accounts and information about
them.  It can be accessed by selecting <B>Manage</B> from the Accounts menu.
Clicking <I>Delete</I> will delete the currently selected account.
Clicking <I>Add</I> or <I>Modify</I> will invoke a <B>Modify Account</B>
window.  Here, the user  can add or alter account information.  When creating
a new account, the user will submit a username and password.  The user will
also choose the protocol for the account.
<P>
If <I>Remember Password</I> is chosen, the password will be saved in
Pidgin's <I>~/.purple/accounts.xml</I> configuration file.
<P>
If <I>Enabled</I> is checked in the accounts dialog, this account will
follow the status currently selected in the status selector.  If it is
not checked, the account will always be offline.
<P>
Each protocol has its own specific options that can be found in the
modify screen.
<P>

<H2>CONVERSATIONS</H2>

When starting a new conversation, the user is presented with the
<B>Conversation</B> window.  The conversation appears in the upper text box
and the user types his/her message in the lower text box.  Between the two
is a row of options, represented by icons.  Some or all buttons may not be
active if the protocol does not support the specific formatting. From left
to right:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="53"><B>Font</B>

<DD>
This menu provides font control options for the current conversation.  Size,
style, and face may be configured here.
<DT id="54"><B>Insert</B>

This menu provides the ability to insert images, horizontal rules, and links
where the protocol supports each of these features.
<DT id="55"><B>Smile!</B>

<DD>
Allows the insertion of graphical smileys via the mouse.  This button shows
the user a dialog with the available smileys for the current conversation.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CHATS</H2>

For protocols that allow it, <B>Chats</B> can be entered through the

not appear in the chat window, but instead open a new IM conversation.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STATUS MESSAGES</H2>

Most protocols allow for status messages.  By using status messages, a user
can leave an informative message for others to see.  Status and status
messages are configured via the status selector at the bottom of the Buddy
List window.  By default the menu shown here is divided into sections for
&quot;primitive&quot; status types, such as <I>Available</I>, <I>Away</I>, etc.; a few
&quot;popular&quot; statuses (including &quot;transient&quot; statuses)  which have been
recently used, and a section which shows <B>New Status...</B> and <B>Saved
Statuses...</B> options for more advanced status manipulation.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="61"><B>Primitive Statuses</B>

<DD>
A primitive status is a basic status supported by the protocol.  Examples of
primitive statuses would be Available, Away, Invisible, etc.  A primitive
status can be used to create a <B>Transient Status or a Saved Status</B>,
both explained below.  Essentially, primitive statuses are building blocks
of more complicated statuses.
<P>
<DT id="62"><B>Transient Statuses</B>

<DD>
When one of the statuses from the topmost section of the status selector's
menu is selected, this creates a transient, or temporary, status.  The status
will show in the &quot;popular statuses&quot; section in the menu until it has not been
used for a sufficiently long time.  A transient status may also be created by
selecting <I>New Status...</I> from the status selector's menu, then clicking
<I>Use</I> once the user has entered the message.
<P>
<DT id="63"><B>Saved Statuses</B>

<DD>
Saved statuses are permanent--once created, they will exist until deleted.
Saved statuses are useful for statuses and status messages that will be used
on a regular basis.  They are also useful for creating complex statuses in
which some accounts should always have a different status from others.  For
example, one might wish to create a status called &quot;Sleeping&quot; that has all
accounts set to &quot;Away&quot;, then create another status called &quot;Working&quot; that
has three accounts set to &quot;Away&quot; and another account set to &quot;Available.&quot;
<P>
<DT id="64"><B>New Status Window</B>

<DD>
When the user selects <I>New Status...</I> from the status selector menu,
Pidgin presents the user with a dialog asking for status-related information.
That information is discussed below:
<P>
<I>Title</I> - The name of the status that will appear in the status selctor's
menu.  If the user clicks the <I>Save</I> or <I>Save &amp; Use</I> button, this
name will also be shown in the <B>Saved Status Window</B>.  The title should
be a short description of the status.
<P>
<I>Status</I> - The type of status being created, such as Available, Away, etc.
<P>
<I>Message</I> - The content of the status message.  This is what is visible
to other users.  Some protocols will allow formatting in some status messages;
where formatting is not supported it will be stripped to the bare text entered.
<P>
<I>Use a different status for some accounts</I> - This allows the creation of
complex statuses in which some accounts' status differs from that of other
accounts.  To use this, the user will click the expander to the left of the
text, then select individual accounts which will have a different status
and/or status message.  When the user selects an account, Pidgin will present
another status dialog asking for a status and a message just for the selected
account.
<P>
<DT id="65"><B>Saved Status Window</B>

<DD>
When the user selects <I>Saved Statuses...</I> from the status selector's menu,
Pidgin presents a dialog that lists all saved statuses.  &quot;Transient&quot; statuses,
discussed above, are <B></B><I>NOT</I> shown here.  This window provides the
ability to manage saved statuses by allowing the creation, modification, and
deletion of saved statuses.  The <I>Use</I>, <I>Modify</I>, and <I>Delete</I>
buttons here allow operation on the status selected from the list; the dd
button allows creation of a new saved status, and the <I>Close</I> button closes
the window.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUDDY POUNCE</H2>

A Buddy Pounce is an automated trigger that occurs when a buddy returns to
a normal state from an away state.  The <B>Buddy Pounce</B> dialog box
can be activated by selecting the <I>Buddy Pounce</I> option from the
<B>Tools</B> menu. From this dialog, new pounces can be created with the
<B>Add</B> button and existing pounces can be removed with the <B>Delete</B>
button.  A pounce can be set to occur on any combination of the
events listed, and any combination of actions can result.  If <I>Pounce
only when my status is not Available</I> is checked, the pounce will occur
only if the user is set to a non-available status, such as invisible, do not
disturb, away, etc.  If <I>Recurring</I> is checked, the pounce will remain
until removed by the <B>Delete</B> button.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CUSTOM SMILIES</H2>

Pidgin 2.5.0 introduced support for custom smilies on those protocols for which
interested contributors have developed support.  The custom smiley manager can
be accessed by selecting <I>Smiley</I> from the <I>Tools</I> menu.  From here,
custom smilies may be added, edited, or deleted by clicking the <I>Add</I>,
<I>Edit</I>, or <I>Delete</I> buttons, respectively.
<P>
During a conversation with another user, that user's custom smileys may be
added to the user's own custom smiley list directly from the conversation
window by right-clicking the new custom smiley and selecting <I>Add Custom
Smiley...</I>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
