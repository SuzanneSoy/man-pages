<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

GIMP is the <I>GNU Image Manipulation Program</I>. It is used to edit
and manipulate images. It can load and save a variety of image formats
and can be used to convert between formats.
<P>

GIMP can also be used as a paint program. It features a set of drawing
and painting tools such as airbrush, clone, pencil, and paint
brush. Painting and drawing tools can be applied to an image with a
variety of paint modes.  It also offers an extensive array of
selection tools like rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select,
intelligent scissors, and select by color.
<P>

GIMP offers a variety of plug-ins that perform a variety of image
manipulations.  Examples include bumpmap, edge detect, gaussian blur,
and many others. In addition, GIMP has several scripting extensions
which allow for advanced non-interactive processing and creation of
images.
<P>

GIMP ships with a second binary called <I>gimp-console</I>. This binary
is a console-only version and behaves as if <I>gimp</I> was called with
the --no-interface command-line option.
<P>

On platforms with the D-Bus message bus system, GIMP will by default check
if an instance is already running in this user session. If it detects that,
it will pass all filenames given on the command-line to the already running
GIMP instance and quit. 
<P>

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

GIMP accepts the following options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>-h, --help</B>

<DD>
Show GIMP command-line options.
<DT id="2"><B>--help-all</B>

<DD>
Show all command-line options.
<DT id="3"><B>--help-gtk</B>

<DD>
Show GTK+ command-line options.
<DT id="4"><B>--help-gegl</B>

<DD>
Show GEGL command-line options.
<DT id="5"><B>-v, --version</B>

<DD>
Output version information and exit. When combined with the --verbose
option, version information about libraries used by GIMP is shown as well.
<DT id="6"><B>--license</B>

<DD>
Output license information and exit.
<DT id="7"><B>--verbose</B>

<DD>
Be verbose and create information on standard output.
<DT id="8"><B>-n, --new-instance</B>

<DD>
Do not attempt to reuse an already running GIMP instance. Always start a
new one.
<DT id="9"><B>-a, --as-new</B>

<DD>
Open filenames passed on the command-line as new images, don't set the
filename on them.
<DT id="10"><B>-i, --no-interface</B>

<DD>
Run without a user interface.
<DT id="11"><B>-d, --no-data</B>

<DD>
Do not load patterns, gradients, palettes, or brushes. Often useful
in non-interactive situations where startup time is to be minimized.
<DT id="12"><B>-f, --no-fonts</B>

<DD>
Do not load any fonts. No text functionality will be available if this
option is used.
<DT id="13"><B>--display </B><I>display</I>

<DD>
Use the designated X display.
<DT id="14"><B>-s, --no-splash</B>

<DD>
Do not show the splash screen.
<DT id="15"><B>--no-shm</B>

<DD>
Do not use shared memory between GIMP and its plug-ins.
Instead of using shared memory, GIMP will send the data via pipe. This
will result in slower performance than using shared memory.
<DT id="16"><B>--no-cpu-accel</B>

<DD>
Do not use CPU accelerations such as MMX or SSE even if GIMP detects
that your CPU provides this functionality.
<DT id="17"><B>--session </B><I>&lt;name&gt;</I>

<DD>
Use a different sessionrc for this GIMP session. The given session
name is appended to the default sessionrc filename.
<DT id="18"><B>-g, --gimprc </B><I>&lt;gimprc&gt;</I>

<DD>
Use an alternative gimprc instead of the default one. Useful in
cases where plug-in paths or machine specs may be different.
<DT id="19"><B>--system-gimprc </B><I>&lt;gimprc&gt;</I>

<DD>
Use an alternate system gimprc file.
<DT id="20"><B>--dump-gimprc</B>

<DD>
Output a gimprc file with default settings.
<DT id="21"><B>--debug-handlers</B>

<DD>
Enable debugging signal handlers.
<DT id="22"><B>-c, --console-messages</B>

<DD>
Do not popup dialog boxes on errors or warnings. Print the messages on
the console instead.
<DT id="23"><B>--stack-trace-mode </B><I>{never|query|always}</I>

<DD>
If a stack-trace should be generated in case of fatal signals.
<DT id="24"><B>--pdb-compat-mode </B><I>{off|on|warn}</I>

<DD>
If the PDB should provide aliases for deprecated functions.
<DT id="25"><B>--batch-interpreter </B><I>&lt;procedure&gt;</I>

<DD>
Specifies the procedure to use to process batch events. The default is
to let Script-Fu evaluate the commands.
<DT id="26"><B>-b, --batch </B><I>&lt;command&gt;</I>

<DD>
Execute <I>&lt;command&gt;</I> non-interactively. This option may appear
multiple times.  The <I>&lt;command&gt;</I> is passed to the batch
interpreter. When <I>&lt;command&gt;</I> is <B>-</B> the commands are read
from standard input.
<P>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

GIMP respects a number of environment variables.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="27"><B>DISPLAY</B>

<DD>
to get the default host and display number.
<DT id="28"><B>GIMP2_DIRECTORY</B>

<DD>
to get the name of the personal GIMP directory. If unset <B>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</B>/GIMP/2.10 is
used.  If this is an absolute path, it is used as is.  If it is a
relative path, it is taken to be a subdirectory of <B>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</B>.
<DT id="29"><B>GIMP2_DATADIR</B>

<DD>
to get the base location for data files such as brushes and patterns.
If unset ${datarootdir}/gimp/2.0 is used.
<DT id="30"><B>GIMP2_LOCALEDIR</B>

<DD>
to get the base location for translations. If unset ${datarootdir}/locale
is used.
<DT id="31"><B>GIMP2_PLUGINDIR</B>

<DD>
to get the base location for plug-ins and modules. If unset
/usr/lib/gimp/2.0 is used.
<DT id="32"><B>GIMP2_SYSCONFDIR</B>

<DD>
to get the location of configuration files. If unset /etc/gimp/2.0
is used.
<DT id="33"><B>GIMP2_CACHEDIR</B>

<DD>
to get the location for caches files. If unset the system default for
per-user cached files is used.
<DT id="34"><B>GIMP2_TEMPDIR</B>

<DD>
to get the location of temporary files. If unset the system default for
temporary files is used.
<P>
On Linux GIMP can be compiled with support for binary relocatibility.
This will cause data, plug-ins and configuration files to be searched
relative to the location of the gimp executable file unless overridden
by the environment variables mentioned above.
<P>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

GIMP's data files are stored in ${datarootdir}/gimp/2.0, where ${datarootdir}
is set on install, but is typically /usr/share. GIMP's system-wide
configuration files are stored in /etc/gimp/2.0, where ${prefix}
is typically /usr.
<P>
Most GIMP configuration is read in from the user's init file,
<B>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</B>/GIMP/2.10/gimprc. The system wide equivalent is in
/etc/gimp/2.0/gimprc. The system wide file is parsed first and the
user gimprc can override the system settings.
/etc/gimp/2.0/gimprc_user is the default gimprc placed in users'
home directories the first time GIMP is run.
<P>
<B>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</B>/GIMP/2.10/devicerc - holds settings for input devices together
with the tool, colors, brush, pattern and gradient associated to that
device.
<P>

used.
<P>
<B>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</B>/GIMP/2.10/unitrc - This file contains your user unit
database. You can modify this list with the unit editor. You are not

<H2>SPLASH IMAGES</H2>

GIMP comes with a default image for the splash screen but it allows
system administrators and users to customize the splash screen by
providing other images. The image to be used with the splash screen is
chosen as follows:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="35">1.<DD>
GIMP tries to load a random splash screen from the directory
<B>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</B>/GIMP/2.10/splashes.
<DT id="36">2.<DD>
It then falls back to using <B>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</B>/GIMP/2.10/gimp-splash.png.
<DT id="37">3.<DD>
If the user didn't install any custom splash images, a random image is
picked from ${datarootdir}/gimp/2.0/splashes.
<DT id="38">4.<DD>
As a last resort, GIMP uses the default splash image located at
${datarootdir}/gimp/2.0/images/gimp-splash.png.

<H2>SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS</H2>

Any bugs found should be reported to the online bug-tracking system
available on the web at
<A HREF="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/issues.">https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/issues.</A> Before reporting bugs,
please check to see if the bug has already been reported.
<P>
When reporting GIMP bugs, it is important to include a reliable way to
reproduce the bug, version number of GIMP (and probably GTK+), OS name
and version, and any relevant hardware specs. If a bug is causing a
crash, it is very useful if a stack trace can be provided. And of
course, patches to rectify the bug are even better.
