<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

diagnostics, splain - produce verbose warning diagnostics
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>



Using the <TT>&quot;diagnostics&quot;</TT> pragma:
<P>



<PRE>
    use diagnostics;
    use diagnostics -verbose;

    enable  diagnostics;
    disable diagnostics;

</PRE>


<P>

Using the <TT>&quot;splain&quot;</TT> standalone filter program:
<P>



<PRE>
    perl program 2&gt;diag.out
    splain [-v] [-p] diag.out

</PRE>


<P>

Using diagnostics to get stack traces from a misbehaving script:
<P>



<PRE>
    perl -Mdiagnostics=-traceonly my_script.pl

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The diagnostics Pragma</H3>





This module extends the terse diagnostics normally emitted by both the
perl compiler and the perl interpreter (from running perl with a -w 
switch or <TT>&quot;use warnings&quot;</TT>), augmenting them with the more
explicative and endearing descriptions found in perldiag.  Like the
other pragmata, it affects the compilation phase of your program rather
than merely the execution phase.
<P>

To use in your program as a pragma, merely invoke
<P>



<PRE>
    use diagnostics;

</PRE>


<P>

at the start (or near the start) of your program.  (Note 
that this <I>does</I> enable perl's <B>-w</B> flag.)  Your whole
compilation will then be subject(ed :-) to the enhanced diagnostics.
These still go out <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>STDERR</B></FONT><B></B>.
<P>

Due to the interaction between runtime and compiletime issues,
and because it's probably not a very good idea anyway,
you may not use <TT>&quot;no diagnostics&quot;</TT> to turn them off at compiletime.
However, you may control their behaviour at runtime using the 
<B>disable()</B> and <B>enable()</B> methods to turn them off and on respectively.
<P>

The <B>-verbose</B> flag first prints out the perldiag introduction before
any other diagnostics.  The <TT>$diagnostics::PRETTY</TT> variable can generate nicer
escape sequences for pagers.
<P>

Warnings dispatched from perl itself (or more accurately, those that match
descriptions found in perldiag) are only displayed once (no duplicate
descriptions).  User code generated warnings a la <B>warn()</B> are unaffected,
allowing duplicate user messages to be displayed.
<P>

This module also adds a stack trace to the error message when perl dies.
This is useful for pinpointing what
caused the death.  The <B>-traceonly</B> (or
just <B>-t</B>) flag turns off the explanations of warning messages leaving just
the stack traces.  So if your script is dieing, run it again with
<P>



<PRE>
  perl -Mdiagnostics=-traceonly my_bad_script

</PRE>


<P>

to see the call stack at the time of death.  By supplying the <B>-warntrace</B>
(or just <B>-w</B>) flag, any warnings emitted will also come with a stack
trace.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The <I>splain</I> Program</H3>



While apparently a whole nuther program, <I>splain</I> is actually nothing
more than a link to the (executable) <I>diagnostics.pm</I> module, as well as
a link to the <I>diagnostics.pod</I> documentation.  The <B>-v</B> flag is like
the <TT>&quot;use diagnostics -verbose&quot;</TT> directive.
The <B>-p</B> flag is like the
<TT>$diagnostics::PRETTY</TT> variable.  Since you're post-processing with 
<I>splain</I>, there's no sense in being able to <B>enable()</B> or <B>disable()</B> processing.
<P>

Output from <I>splain</I> is directed to <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>STDOUT</B></FONT><B></B>, unlike the pragma.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>



The following file is certain to trigger a few errors at both
runtime and compiletime:
<P>



<PRE>
    use diagnostics;
    print NOWHERE &quot;nothing\n&quot;;
    print STDERR &quot;\n\tThis message should be unadorned.\n&quot;;
    warn &quot;\tThis is a user warning&quot;;
    print &quot;\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTER: Please enter a &lt;CR&gt; here: &quot;;
    my $a, $b = scalar &lt;STDIN&gt;;
    print &quot;\n&quot;;
    print $x/$y;

</PRE>


<P>

If you prefer to run your program first and look at its problem
afterwards, do this:
<P>



<PRE>
    perl -w test.pl 2&gt;test.out
    ./splain &lt; test.out

</PRE>


<P>

Note that this is not in general possible in shells of more dubious heritage, 
as the theoretical
<P>



<PRE>
    (perl -w test.pl &gt;/dev/tty) &gt;&amp; test.out
    ./splain &lt; test.out

</PRE>


<P>

Because you just moved the existing <B>stdout</B> to somewhere else.
<P>

If you don't want to modify your source code, but still have on-the-fly
warnings, do this:
<P>



<PRE>
    exec 3&gt;&amp;1; perl -w test.pl 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;- | splain 1&gt;&amp;2 3&gt;&amp;-

</PRE>


<P>

Nifty, eh?
<P>

If you want to control warnings on the fly, do something like this.
Make sure you do the <TT>&quot;use&quot;</TT> first, or you won't be able to get
at the <B>enable()</B> or <B>disable()</B> methods.
<P>



<PRE>
    use diagnostics; # checks entire compilation phase 
        print &quot;\ntime for 1st bogus diags: SQUAWKINGS\n&quot;;
        print BOGUS1 'nada';
        print &quot;done with 1st bogus\n&quot;;

    disable diagnostics; # only turns off runtime warnings
        print &quot;\ntime for 2nd bogus: (squelched)\n&quot;;
        print BOGUS2 'nada';
        print &quot;done with 2nd bogus\n&quot;;

    enable diagnostics; # turns back on runtime warnings
        print &quot;\ntime for 3rd bogus: SQUAWKINGS\n&quot;;
        print BOGUS3 'nada';
        print &quot;done with 3rd bogus\n&quot;;

    disable diagnostics;
        print &quot;\ntime for 4th bogus: (squelched)\n&quot;;
        print BOGUS4 'nada';
        print &quot;done with 4th bogus\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INTERNALS</H2>



Diagnostic messages derive from the <I>perldiag.pod</I> file when available at
runtime.  Otherwise, they may be embedded in the file itself when the
splain package is built.   See the <I>Makefile</I> for details.
<P>

If an extant <TT>$SIG</TT>{__WARN__} handler is discovered, it will continue
to be honored, but only after the <B>diagnostics::splainthis()</B> function 
(the module's <TT>$SIG</TT>{__WARN__} interceptor) has had its way with your
warnings.
<P>

There is a <TT>$diagnostics::DEBUG</TT> variable you may set if you're desperately
curious what sorts of things are being intercepted.
<P>



<PRE>
    BEGIN { $diagnostics::DEBUG = 1 }

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>



Not being able to say ``no diagnostics'' is annoying, but may not be
insurmountable.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;-pretty&quot;</TT> directive is called too late to affect matters.
You have to do this instead, and <I>before</I> you load the module.
<P>



<PRE>
    BEGIN { $diagnostics::PRETTY = 1 }

</PRE>


<P>

I could start up faster by delaying compilation until it should be
needed, but this gets a ``panic: top_level'' when using the pragma form
in Perl 5.001e.
<P>

While it's true that this documentation is somewhat subserious, if you use
a program named <I>splain</I>, you should expect a bit of whimsy.
