<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <B>tput</B> utility uses the <B>terminfo</B> database to make the
values of terminal-dependent capabilities and information available to
the shell (see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+sh">sh</A></B>(1)), to initialize or reset the terminal, or
return the long name of the requested terminal type.
The result depends upon the capability's type:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2">string<DD>
<B>tput</B> writes the string to the standard output.
No trailing newline is supplied.
<DT id="3">integer<DD>
<B>tput</B> writes the decimal value to the standard output,
with a trailing newline.
<DT id="4">boolean<DD>
<B>tput</B> simply sets the exit code
(<B>0</B> for TRUE if the terminal has the capability,
<B>1</B> for FALSE if it does not),
and writes nothing to the standard output.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

Before using a value returned on the standard output,
the application should test the exit code
(e.g., <B>$?</B>, see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+sh">sh</A></B>(1)) to be sure it is <B>0</B>.
(See the <B>EXIT CODES</B> and <B>DIAGNOSTICS</B> sections.)
For a complete list of capabilities
and the <I>capname</I> associated with each, see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+terminfo">terminfo</A></B>(5).
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Options</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="5"><B>-S</B><DD>
allows more than one capability per invocation of <B>tput</B>.  The
capabilities must be passed to <B>tput</B> from the standard input
instead of from the command line (see example).
Only one <I>capname</I> is allowed per line.
The <B>-S</B> option changes the
meaning of the <B>0</B> and <B>1</B> boolean and string exit codes (see the
EXIT CODES section).
<DT id="6"><DD>
Because some capabilities may use
<I>string</I> parameters rather than <I>numbers</I>,
<B>tput</B> uses a table and the presence of parameters in its input
to decide whether to use <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3X+tparm">tparm</A></B>(3X),
and how to interpret the parameters.
<DT id="7"><B>-T</B><I>type</I><DD>
indicates the <I>type</I> of terminal.
Normally this option is
unnecessary, because the default is taken from the environment
variable <B>TERM</B>.
If <B>-T</B> is specified, then the shell
variables <B>LINES</B> and <B>COLUMNS</B> will also be ignored.
<DT id="8"><B>-V</B><DD>
reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.
<DT id="9"><B>-x</B>

<DD>
do not attempt to clear the terminal's scrollback buffer
using the extended ``E3'' capability.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Commands</H3>

A few commands (<B>init</B>, <B>reset</B> and <B>longname</B>) are
special; they are defined by the <B>tput</B> program.
The others are the names of <I>capabilities</I> from the terminal database
(see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+terminfo">terminfo</A></B>(5) for a list).
Although <B>init</B> and <B>reset</B> resemble capability names,
<B>tput</B> uses several capabilities to perform these special functions.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="10"><I>capname</I><DD>
indicates the capability from the terminal database.
<DT id="11"><DD>
If the capability is a string that takes parameters, the arguments
following the capability will be used as parameters for the string.
<DT id="12"><DD>
Most parameters are numbers.
Only a few terminal capabilities require string parameters;
<B>tput</B> uses a table to decide which to pass as strings.
Normally <B>tput</B> uses <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3X+tparm">tparm</A></B>(3X) to perform the substitution.
If no parameters are given for the capability,
<B>tput</B> writes the string without performing the substitution.
<DT id="13"><B>init</B><DD>
If the terminal database is present and an entry for the user's
terminal exists (see <B>-T</B><I>type</I>, above), the following will
occur:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="14"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="15">(1)<DD>
first, <B>tput</B> retrieves the current terminal mode settings
for your terminal.
It does this by successively testing
<DL COMPACT><DT id="16"><DD>

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


the standard error,

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


standard output,

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


standard input and

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


ultimately ``/dev/tty''
</DL>

<DT id="17"><DD>
to obtain terminal settings.
Having retrieved these settings, <B>tput</B> remembers which
file descriptor to use when updating settings.
<DT id="18">(2)<DD>
if the window size cannot be obtained from the operating system,
but the terminal description (or environment, e.g., <B>LINES</B>
and <B>COLUMNS</B> variables specify this),
update the operating system's notion of the window size.
<DT id="19">(3)<DD>
the terminal modes will be updated:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="20"><DD>

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry will
be set in the tty driver,

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


tabs expansion will be turned on or off according to
the specification in the entry, and

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


if tabs are not expanded,
standard tabs will be set (every 8 spaces).
</DL>

<DT id="21">(4)<DD>
if present, the terminal's initialization strings will be
output as detailed in the <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+terminfo">terminfo</A></B>(5) section on
<I>Tabs and Initialization</I>,

<DT id="22">(5)<DD>
output is flushed.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="23"><DD>
If an entry does not
contain the information needed for any of these activities,
that activity will silently be skipped.
<DT id="24"><B>reset</B><DD>
This is similar to <B>init</B>, with two differences:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="25"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="26">(1)<DD>
before any other initialization,
the terminal modes will be reset to a ``sane'' state:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="27"><DD>

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


set cooked and echo modes,

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


turn off cbreak and raw modes,

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


turn on newline translation and

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


reset any unset special characters to their default values
</DL>

<DT id="28">(2)<DD>
Instead of putting out <I>initialization</I> strings, the terminal's
<I>reset</I> strings will be output if present
(<B>rs1</B>, <B>rs2</B>, <B>rs3</B>, <B>rf</B>).
If the <I>reset</I> strings are not present, but <I>initialization</I>
strings are, the <I>initialization</I> strings will be output.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="29"><DD>
Otherwise, <B>reset</B> acts identically to <B>init</B>.
<DT id="30"><B>longname</B><DD>
If the terminal database is present and an entry for the
user's terminal exists (see <B>-T</B><I>type</I> above), then the long name
of the terminal will be put out.
The long name is the last
name in the first line of the terminal's description in the
<B>terminfo</B> database [see <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+term">term</A></B>(5)].
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Aliases</H3>

<B>tput</B> handles the <B>clear</B>, <B>init</B> and <B>reset</B>
commands specially:
it allows for the possibility that it is invoked by a link with those names.
<P>

If <B>tput</B> is invoked by a link named <B>reset</B>, this has the
same effect as <B>tput reset</B>.
The <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+tset">tset</A></B>(1) utility also treats a link named <B>reset</B> specially.
<P>

Before ncurses 6.1, the two utilities were different from each other:

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


<B>tset</B> utility reset the terminal modes and special characters
(not done with <B>tput</B>).

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


On the other hand, <B>tset</B>'s repertoire of terminal capabilities for
resetting the terminal was more limited,
i.e., only <B>reset_1string</B>, <B>reset_2string</B> and <B>reset_file</B>
in contrast to the tab-stops and margins which are set by this utility.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


The <B>reset</B> program is usually an alias for <B>tset</B>,
because of this difference with resetting terminal modes and special characters.
<P>

With the changes made for ncurses 6.1, the <I>reset</I> feature of the
two programs is (mostly) the same.
A few differences remain:

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


The <B>tset</B> program waits one second when resetting,
in case it happens to be a hardware terminal.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


The two programs write the terminal initialization strings
to different streams (i.e., the standard error for <B>tset</B> and the
standard output for <B>tput</B>).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="31"><DD>
<B>Note:</B> although these programs write to different streams,
redirecting their output to a file will capture only part of their actions.
The changes to the terminal modes are not affected by redirecting the output.
</DL>
<P>

If <B>tput</B> is invoked by a link named <B>init</B>, this has the
same effect as <B>tput init</B>.
Again, you are less likely to use that link because another program
named <B>init</B> has a more well-established use.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Terminal Size</H3>

<P>

Besides the special commands (e.g., <B>clear</B>),
tput treats certain terminfo capabilities specially:
<B>lines</B> and <B>columns</B>.
tput calls <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3X+setupterm">setupterm</A></B>(3X) to obtain the terminal size:

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


first, it gets the size from the terminal database
(which generally is not provided for terminal emulators
which do not have a fixed window size)

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


then it asks the operating system for the terminal's size
(which generally works, unless connecting via a serial line which
does not support <I>NAWS</I>: negotiations about window size).

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


finally, it inspects the environment variables <B>LINES</B> and <B>COLUMNS</B>
which may override the terminal size.
<P>

If the <B>-T</B> option is given
tput ignores the environment variables by calling <B>use_tioctl(TRUE)</B>,
relying upon the operating system (or finally, the terminal database).
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="32"><B>tput init</B><DD>
Initialize the terminal according to the type of
terminal in the environmental variable <B>TERM</B>.  This
command should be included in everyone's .profile after
the environmental variable <B>TERM</B> has been exported, as

<DT id="33"><B>tput -T5620 reset</B><DD>
Reset an AT&amp;T 5620 terminal, overriding the type of
terminal in the environmental variable <B>TERM</B>.
<DT id="34"><B>tput cup 0 0</B><DD>
Send the sequence to move the cursor to row <B>0</B>, column <B>0</B>

<H2>EXIT CODES</H2>

If the <B>-S</B> option is used,
<B>tput</B> checks for errors from each line,
and if any errors are found, will set the exit code to 4 plus the
number of lines with errors.
If no errors are found, the exit code is <B>0</B>.
No indication of which line failed can be given so
exit code <B>1</B> will never appear.
Exit codes <B>2</B>, <B>3</B>, and
<B>4</B> retain their usual interpretation.
If the <B>-S</B> option is not used,
the exit code depends on the type of <I>capname</I>:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="47"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="48"><I>boolean</I>

<DD>
a value of <B>0</B> is set for TRUE and <B>1</B> for FALSE.
<DT id="49"><I>string</I>

<DD>
a value of <B>0</B> is set if the
<I>capname</I> is defined for this terminal <I>type</I> (the value of
<I>capname</I> is returned on standard output);
a value of <B>1</B> is set if <I>capname</I>
is not defined for this terminal <I>type</I>
(nothing is written to standard output).
<DT id="50"><I>integer</I>

<DD>
a value of <B>0</B> is always set,
whether or not <I>capname</I> is defined for this terminal <I>type</I>.
To determine if <I>capname</I> is defined for this terminal <I>type</I>,
the user must test the value written to standard output.
A value of <B>-1</B>
means that <I>capname</I> is not defined for this terminal <I>type</I>.
<DT id="51"><I>other</I>

<DD>
<B>reset</B> or <B>init</B> may fail to find their respective files.
In that case, the exit code is set to 4 + <B>errno</B>.

<H2>HISTORY</H2>

The <B>tput</B> command was begun by Bill Joy in 1980.
The initial version only cleared the screen.
<P>

AT&amp;T System V provided a different <B>tput</B> command,
whose <B>init</B> and <B>reset</B>  subcommands
(more than half the program) were incorporated from
the <B>reset</B> feature of BSD <B>tset</B> written by Eric Allman.
<P>

Keith Bostic replaced the BSD <B>tput</B> command in 1989
with a new implementation
based on the AT&amp;T System V program <B>tput</B>.
Like the AT&amp;T program, Bostic's version
accepted some parameters named for <I>terminfo capabilities</I>
(<B>clear</B>, <B>init</B>, <B>longname</B> and <B>reset</B>).
However (because he had only termcap available),
it accepted <I>termcap names</I> for other capabilities.
Also, Bostic's BSD <B>tput</B> did not modify the terminal I/O modes
as the earlier BSD <B>tset</B> had done.
<P>

At the same time, Bostic added a shell script named ``clear'',
which used <B>tput</B> to clear the screen.
<P>

Both of these appeared in 4.4BSD,
becoming the ``modern'' BSD implementation of <B>tput</B>.
<P>

This implementation of <B>tput</B> began from a different source than
AT&amp;T or BSD: Ross Ridge's <I>mytinfo</I> package, published on
<I>comp.sources.unix</I> in December 1992.
Ridge's program made more sophisticated use of the terminal capabilities
than the BSD program.
Eric Raymond used that <B>tput</B> program
(and other parts of <I>mytinfo</I>) in ncurses in June 1995.
Using the portions dealing with terminal capabilities
almost without change,
Raymond made improvements to the way the command-line parameters
were handled.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2>

<P>

This implementation of <B>tput</B> differs from AT&amp;T <B>tput</B> in
two important areas:

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


<B>tput</B> <I>capname</I> writes to the standard output.
That need not be a regular terminal.
However, the subcommands which manipulate terminal modes
may not use the standard output.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="52"><DD>
The AT&amp;T implementation's <B>init</B> and <B>reset</B> commands
use the BSD (4.1c) <B>tset</B> source, which manipulates terminal modes.
It successively tries standard output, standard error, standard input
before falling back to ``/dev/tty'' and finally just assumes
a 1200Bd terminal.
When updating terminal modes, it ignores errors.
<DT id="53"><DD>
Until changes made after ncurses 6.0,
<B>tput</B> did not modify terminal modes.
<B>tput</B> now uses a similar scheme,
using functions shared with <B>tset</B>
(and ultimately based on the 4.4BSD <B>tset</B>).
If it is not able to open a terminal, e.g., when running in <B>cron</B>,
<B>tput</B> will return an error.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


AT&amp;T <B>tput</B> guesses the type of its <I>capname</I> operands by seeing if
all of the characters are numeric, or not.
<DT id="54"><DD>
Most implementations which provide support for <I>capname</I> operands
use the <I>tparm</I> function to expand parameters in it.
That function expects a mixture of numeric and string parameters,
requiring <B>tput</B> to know which type to use.
<DT id="55"><DD>
This implementation uses a table to determine the parameter types for
the standard <I>capname</I> operands, and an internal library
function to analyze nonstandard <I>capname</I> operands.
</DL>
<P>

This implementation (unlike others) can accept both <I>termcap</I>
and <I>terminfo</I> names for the <I>capname</I> feature,
if
<I>termcap</I> support is compiled in.
However, the predefined <I>termcap</I> and <I>terminfo</I> names have two
ambiguities in this case (and the <I>terminfo</I> name is assumed):

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


The <I>termcap</I> name <B>dl</B> corresponds to
the <I>terminfo</I> name <B>dl1</B> (delete one line).
<BR>

The <I>terminfo</I> name <B>dl</B> corresponds to
the <I>termcap</I> name <B>DL</B> (delete a given number of lines).

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


The <I>termcap</I> name <B>ed</B> corresponds to
the <I>terminfo</I> name <B>rmdc</B> (end delete mode).
<BR>

The <I>terminfo</I> name <B>ed</B> corresponds to
the <I>termcap</I> name <B>cd</B> (clear to end of screen).
<P>

The <B>longname</B> and <B>-S</B> options, and the parameter-substitution
features used in the <B>cup</B> example,
were not supported in BSD curses before 4.3reno (1989) or in
AT&amp;T/USL curses before SVr4 (1988).
<P>

IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group  Base Specifications Issue 7 (POSIX.1-2008) 
documents only the operands for <B>clear</B>, <B>init</B> and <B>reset</B>.
There are a few interesting observations to make regarding that:

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


In this implementation, <B>clear</B> is part of the <I>capname</I> support.
The others (<B>init</B> and <B>longname</B>) do not correspond to terminal
capabilities.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


Other implementations of <B>tput</B> on
SVr4-based systems such as Solaris, IRIX64 and HPUX
as well as others such as AIX and Tru64
provide support for <I>capname</I> operands.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


A few platforms such as FreeBSD recognize termcap names rather
than terminfo capability names in their respective <B>tput</B> commands.
Since 2010, NetBSD's <B>tput</B> uses terminfo names.
Before that, it (like FreeBSD) recognized termcap names.
<P>

Because (apparently) <I>all</I> of the certified Unix systems
support the full set of capability names, the reasoning for documenting
only a few may not be apparent.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <B>tput</B> differently, with <I>capname</I>
and the other features used in this implementation.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


That is, there are two standards for <B>tput</B>:
POSIX (a subset) and X/Open Curses (the full implementation).
POSIX documents a subset to avoid the complication of including X/Open Curses
and the terminal capabilities database.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


While it is certainly possible to write a <B>tput</B> program
without using curses,
none of the systems which have a curses implementation provide
a <B>tput</B> utility which does not provide the <I>capname</I> feature.
<P>

X/Open Curses Issue 7 (2009) is the first version to document utilities.
However that part of X/Open Curses does not follow existing practice
(i.e., Unix features documented in SVID 3):

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


It assigns exit code 4 to ``invalid operand'',
which may be the same as <I>unknown capability</I>.
For instance, the source code for Solaris' xcurses uses the term
``invalid'' in this case.

<BR>&nbsp;.IP&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;4


It assigns exit code 255 to a numeric variable that is not specified in
the terminfo database.
That likely is a documentation error,
confusing the <B>-1</B> written to the standard output for an absent
or cancelled numeric value versus an (unsigned) exit code.
<P>

The various Unix systems (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) use the same exit-codes
as ncurses.
<P>

NetBSD curses documents different exit codes which do not correspond
to either ncurses or X/Open.
