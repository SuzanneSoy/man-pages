<H2>NAME</H2>

dpkg - package manager for Debian
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>dpkg</B>

[<I>option</I>...] <I>action</I>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WARNING</H2>

This manual is intended for users wishing to understand <B>dpkg</B>'s
command line options and package states in more detail than that
provided by <B>dpkg --help</B>.
<P>
It should <I>not</I> be used by package maintainers wishing to
understand how <B>dpkg</B> will install their packages. The
descriptions of what <B>dpkg</B> does when installing and removing
packages are particularly inadequate.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>dpkg</B> is a tool to install, build, remove and manage
Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly
front-end for <B>dpkg</B> is <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+aptitude">aptitude</A></B>(1). <B>dpkg</B> itself is
controlled entirely via command line parameters, which consist of exactly
one action and zero or more options. The action-parameter tells <B>dpkg</B>
what to do and options control the behavior of the action in some way.
<P>
<B>dpkg</B> can also be used as a front-end to <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dpkg-deb">dpkg-deb</A></B>(1) and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dpkg-query">dpkg-query</A></B>(1). The list of supported actions can be found later on
in the <B>ACTIONS</B> section. If any such action is encountered <B>dpkg</B>
just runs <B>dpkg-deb</B> or <B>dpkg-query</B> with the parameters given
to it, but no specific options are currently passed to them, to use
any such option the back-ends need to be called directly.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INFORMATION ABOUT PACKAGES</H2>

<B>dpkg</B> maintains some usable information about available
packages. The information is divided in three classes: <B>states</B>,
<B>selection states</B> and <B>flags</B>. These values are intended to
be changed mainly with <B>dselect</B>.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Package states</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1"><B>not-installed</B>

<DD>
The package is not installed on your system.
<DT id="2"><B>config-files</B>

<DD>
Only the configuration files of the package exist on the system.
<DT id="3"><B>half-installed</B>

<DD>
The installation of the package has been started, but not completed for
some reason.
<DT id="4"><B>unpacked</B>

<DD>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Package selection states</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="9"><B>install</B>

<DD>
The package is selected for installation.
<DT id="10"><B>hold</B>

<DD>

unless forced to do that with option <B>--force-hold</B>.
<DT id="11"><B>deinstall</B>

<DD>
The package is selected for deinstallation (i.e. we want to remove all
files, except configuration files).
<DT id="12"><B>purge</B>

<DD>
The package is selected to be purged (i.e. we want to remove everything
from system directories, even configuration files).
<DT id="13"><B>unknown</B>

<DD>
The package selection is unknown.
A package that is also in a <B>not-installed</B> state, and with an
<B>ok</B> flag will be forgotten in the next database store.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Package flags</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="14"><B>ok</B>

<DD>
A package marked <B>ok</B> is in a known state, but might need further
processing.
<DT id="15"><B>reinstreq</B>

<DD>
A package marked <B>reinstreq</B> is broken and requires
reinstallation. These packages cannot be removed, unless forced with
option <B>--force-remove-reinstreq</B>.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ACTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="16"><B>-i</B>, <B>--install</B> <I>package-file</I>...<DD>
Install the package. If <B>--recursive</B> or <B>-R</B> option is
specified, <I>package-file</I> must refer to a directory instead.
<P>
Installation consists of the following steps:
<BR>

<P>
<B>1.</B> Extract the control files of the new package.
<BR>

<P>
<B>2.</B> If another version of the same package was installed before
the new installation, execute <I>prerm</I> script of the old package.
<BR>

<P>
<B>3.</B> Run <I>preinst</I> script, if provided by the package.
<BR>

<P>
<B>4.</B> Unpack the new files, and at the same time back up the old
files, so that if something goes wrong, they can be restored.
<BR>

<P>
<B>5.</B> If another version of the same package was installed before
the new installation, execute the <I>postrm</I> script of the old
package. Note that this script is executed after the <I>preinst</I>
script of the new package, because new files are written at the same
time old files are removed.
<BR>

<P>
<B>6.</B> Configure the package. See <B>--configure</B> for detailed
information about how this is done.
<DT id="17"><B>--unpack </B><I>package-file</I>...<DD>
Unpack the package, but don't configure it. If <B>--recursive</B> or
<B>-R</B> option is specified, <I>package-file</I> must refer to a
directory instead.
<DT id="18"><B>--configure </B><I>package</I>...|<B>-a</B>|<B>--pending</B><DD>
Configure a package which has been unpacked but not yet configured.
If <B>-a</B> or <B>--pending</B> is given instead of <I>package</I>,
all unpacked but unconfigured packages are configured.
<P>
To reconfigure a package which has already been configured, try the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+dpkg-reconfigure">dpkg-reconfigure</A></B>(8)

command instead.
<P>
Configuring consists of the following steps:
<BR>

<P>
<B>1.</B> Unpack the conffiles, and at the same time back up
the old conffiles, so that they can be restored if
something goes wrong.
<BR>

<P>
<B>2.</B> Run <I>postinst</I> script, if provided by the package.
<DT id="19"><B>--triggers-only</B> <I>package</I>...|<B>-a</B>|<B>--pending</B><DD>
Processes only triggers (since dpkg 1.14.17).
All pending triggers will be processed.
If package
names are supplied only those packages' triggers will be processed, exactly
once each where necessary. Use of this option may leave packages in the
improper <B>triggers-awaited</B> and <B>triggers-pending</B> states. This
can be fixed later by running: <B>dpkg --configure --pending</B>.
<DT id="20"><B>-r</B>, <B>--remove</B> <I>package</I>...|<B>-a</B>|<B>--pending</B><DD>
Remove an installed package.
This removes everything except conffiles and other data cleaned up by
the <I>postrm</I> script,
which may avoid having to reconfigure the package if it is reinstalled
later (conffiles are configuration files that are listed in the
<I>DEBIAN/conffiles</I> control file).
If there is no <I>DEBIAN/conffiles</I> control file nor <I>DEBIAN/postrm</I>
script, this command is equivalent to calling <B>--purge</B>.
If <B>-a</B> or <B>--pending</B> is given instead of a package name,
then all packages unpacked, but marked to be removed in file
<I>/var/lib/dpkg/status</I>, are removed.
<P>
Removing of a package consists of the following steps:
<BR>

<P>
<B>1.</B> Run <I>prerm</I> script
<BR>

<P>
<B>2.</B> Remove the installed files
<BR>

<P>
<B>3.</B> Run <I>postrm</I> script
<BR>

<P>
<DT id="21"><B>-P</B>, <B>--purge</B> <I>package</I>...|<B>-a</B>|<B>--pending</B><DD>
Purge an installed or already removed package. This removes everything,
including conffiles, and anything else cleaned up from <I>postrm</I>.
If <B>-a</B> or <B>--pending</B> is given instead of a package name,
then all packages unpacked or removed, but marked to be purged in file
<I>/var/lib/dpkg/status</I>, are purged.
<P>
Note: some configuration files might be unknown to <B>dpkg</B> because they
are created and handled separately through the configuration scripts. In
that case, <B>dpkg</B> won't remove them by itself, but the package's
<I>postrm</I> script (which is called by <B>dpkg</B>), has to take care of
their removal during purge. Of course, this only applies to files in
system directories, not configuration files written to individual users'
home directories.
<P>
Purging of a package consists of the following steps:
<BR>

<P>
<B>1.</B> Remove the package, if not already removed. See <B>--remove</B>
for detailed information about how this is done.
<BR>

<P>
<B>2.</B> Run <I>postrm</I> script.
<BR>

<DT id="22"><B>-V</B>, <B>--verify</B> [<I>package-name</I>...]

<DD>
Verifies the integrity of <I>package-name</I> or all packages if omitted,
by comparing information from the files installed by a package with the
files metadata information stored in the <B>dpkg</B> database
(since dpkg 1.17.2).
The origin
of the files metadata information in the database is the binary packages
themselves. That metadata gets collected at package unpack time during
the installation process.
<P>
Currently the only functional check performed is an md5sum verification
of the file contents against the stored value in the files database.
It will only get checked
if the database contains the file md5sum. To check for any missing
metadata in the database, the <B>--audit</B> command can be used.
<P>
The output format is selectable with the <B>--verify-format</B>
option, which by default uses the <B>rpm</B> format, but that might
change in the future, and as such, programs parsing this command
output should be explicit about the format they expect.
<DT id="23"><B>-C</B>, <B>--audit</B> [<I>package-name</I>...]

<DD>
Performs database sanity and consistency checks for <I>package-name</I>
or all packages if omitted (per package checks since dpkg 1.17.10).
For example, searches for packages that have been installed only partially
on your system or that have missing, wrong or obsolete control data or
files. <B>dpkg</B> will suggest what to do with them to get them fixed.
<DT id="24"><B>--update-avail</B> [<I>Packages-file</I>]

<DD>

<B>--merge-avail</B> [<I>Packages-file</I>]

Update <B>dpkg</B>'s and <B>dselect</B>'s idea of which packages are
available. With action <B>--merge-avail</B>, old information is
combined with information from <I>Packages-file</I>. With action
<B>--update-avail</B>, old information is replaced with the information
in the <I>Packages-file</I>. The <I>Packages-file</I> distributed with
Debian is simply named &laquo;<I>Packages</I>&raquo;. If the <I>Packages-file</I>
argument is missing or named &laquo;<B>-</B>&raquo; then it will be read from
standard input (since dpkg 1.17.7). <B>dpkg</B> keeps its record of
available packages in <I>/var/lib/dpkg/available</I>.
<P>
A simpler one-shot command to retrieve and update the <I>available</I>
file is <B>dselect update</B>. Note that this file is mostly useless
if you don't use <B>dselect</B> but an APT-based frontend: APT has its
own system to keep track of available packages.
<DT id="25"><B>-A</B>, <B>--record-avail</B> <I>package-file</I>...<DD>
Update <B>dpkg</B> and <B>dselect</B>'s idea of which packages are
available with information from the package <I>package-file</I>. If
<B>--recursive</B> or <B>-R</B> option is specified, <I>package-file</I>
must refer to a directory instead.
<DT id="26"><B>--forget-old-unavail</B>

<DD>
Now <B>obsolete</B> and a no-op as <B>dpkg</B> will automatically forget
uninstalled unavailable packages (since dpkg 1.15.4), but only those that
do not contain user information such as package selections.
<DT id="27"><B>--clear-avail</B>

<DD>
Erase the existing information about what packages are available.
<DT id="28"><B>--get-selections</B> [<I>package-name-pattern</I>...]<DD>
Get list of package selections, and write it to stdout. Without a pattern,
non-installed packages (i.e. those which have been previously purged) will
not be shown.
<DT id="29"><B>--set-selections</B>

<DD>
Set package selections using file read from stdin. This file should be
in the format "<I>package</I> <I>state</I>", where state is one of
<B>install</B>, <B>hold</B>, <B>deinstall</B> or <B>purge</B>. Blank lines
and comment lines beginning with '<B>#</B>' are also permitted.
<P>
The <I>available</I> file needs to be up-to-date for this command to be
useful, otherwise unknown packages will be ignored with a warning. See
the <B>--update-avail</B> and <B>--merge-avail</B> commands for more
information.
<DT id="30"><B>--clear-selections</B>

<DD>
Set the requested state of every non-essential package to deinstall
(since dpkg 1.13.18).
This is intended to be used immediately before <B>--set-selections</B>,
to deinstall any packages not in list given to <B>--set-selections</B>.
<DT id="31"><B>--yet-to-unpack</B>

<DD>
Searches for packages selected for installation, but which for some
reason still haven't been installed.
<DT id="32"><DD>
Note: This command makes use of both the available file and the package
selections.
<DT id="33"><B>--predep-package</B>

<DD>
Print a single package which is the target of one or more relevant
pre-dependencies and has itself no unsatisfied pre-dependencies.
<DT id="34"><DD>
If such a package is present, output it as a Packages file entry,
which can be massaged as appropriate.
<DT id="35"><DD>
Note: This command makes use of both the available file and the package
selections.
<DT id="36"><DD>
Returns 0 when a package is printed, 1 when no suitable package is
available and 2 on error.
<DT id="37"><B>--add-architecture </B><I>architecture</I>

<DD>
Add <I>architecture</I> to the list of architectures for which packages can
be installed without using <B>--force-architecture</B> (since dpkg 1.16.2).
The architecture
<B>dpkg</B> is built for (i.e. the output of <B>--print-architecture</B>)
is always part of that list.
<DT id="38"><B>--remove-architecture </B><I>architecture</I>

<DD>
Remove <I>architecture</I> from the list of architectures for which packages
can be installed without using <B>--force-architecture</B>
(since dpkg 1.16.2). If the
architecture is currently in use in the database then the operation will
be refused, except if <B>--force-architecture</B> is specified. The
architecture <B>dpkg</B> is built for (i.e. the output of
<B>--print-architecture</B>) can never be removed from that list.
<DT id="39"><B>--print-architecture</B>

<DD>
Print architecture of packages <B>dpkg</B> installs (for example, "i386").
<DT id="40"><B>--print-foreign-architectures</B>

<DD>
Print a newline-separated list of the extra architectures <B>dpkg</B> is
configured to allow packages to be installed for (since dpkg 1.16.2).
<DT id="41"><B>--assert-</B><I>feature</I>

<DD>
Asserts that <B>dpkg</B> supports the requested feature.
Returns 0 if the feature is fully supported, 1 if the feature is known but
<B>dpkg</B> cannot provide support for it yet, and 2 if the feature is unknown.
The current list of assertable features is:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="42"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="43"><B>support-predepends</B>

<DD>
Supports the <B>Pre-Depends</B> field (since dpkg 1.1.0).
<DT id="44"><B>working-epoch</B>

<DD>
Supports epochs in version strings (since dpkg 1.4.0.7).
<DT id="45"><B>long-filenames</B>

<DD>
Supports long filenames in <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+deb">deb</A></B>(5) archives (since dpkg 1.4.1.17).
<DT id="46"><B>multi-conrep</B>

<DD>
Supports multiple <B>Conflicts</B> and <B>Replaces</B> (since dpkg 1.4.1.19).
<DT id="47"><B>multi-arch</B>

<DD>
Supports multi-arch fields and semantics (since dpkg 1.16.2).
<DT id="48"><B>versioned-provides</B>

<DD>
Supports versioned <B>Provides</B> (since dpkg 1.17.11).
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="49"><B>--validate-</B><I>thing string</I>

<DD>
Validate that the <I>thing</I> <I>string</I> has a correct syntax
(since dpkg 1.18.16).
Returns 0 if the <I>string</I> is valid, 1 if the <I>string</I> is invalid but
might be accepted in lax contexts, and 2 if the <I>string</I> is invalid.
The current list of validatable <I>thing</I>s is:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="50"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="51"><B>pkgname</B>

<DD>
Validates the given package name (since dpkg 1.18.16).
<DT id="52"><B>trigname</B>

<DD>
Validates the given trigger name (since dpkg 1.18.16).
<DT id="53"><B>archname</B>

<DD>
Validates the given architecture name (since dpkg 1.18.16).
<DT id="54"><B>version</B>

<DD>
Validates the given version (since dpkg 1.18.16).
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="55"><B>--compare-versions </B><I>ver1 op ver2</I>

<DD>
Compare version numbers, where <I>op</I> is a binary operator. <B>dpkg</B>
returns true (<B>0</B>) if the specified condition is satisfied,
and false (<B>1</B>) otherwise. There are
two groups of operators, which differ in how they treat an empty
<I>ver1</I> or <I>ver2</I>. These treat an empty version as earlier than any
version: <B>lt le eq ne ge gt</B>. These treat an empty version as later
than any version: <B>lt-nl le-nl ge-nl gt-nl</B>. These are provided
only for compatibility with control file syntax: <B>&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;= = &gt;= &gt;&gt;
&gt;</B>. The <B>&lt;</B> and <B>&gt;</B> operators are obsolete and should <B>not</B>
be used, due to confusing semantics. To illustrate: <B>0.1 &lt; 0.1</B>
evaluates to true.

<DT id="65"><B>--force-</B><I>things</I>

<DD>

<B>--no-force-</B><I>things</I>, <B>--refuse-</B><I>things</I>

Force or refuse (<B>no-force</B> and <B>refuse</B> mean the same thing)
to do some things. <I>things</I> is a comma separated list of things
specified below. <B>--force-help</B> displays a message describing them.
Things marked with (*) are forced by default.
<P>
<I>Warning: These options are mostly intended to be used by experts
only. Using them without fully understanding their effects may break
your whole system.</I>
<P>
<B>all</B>:
Turns on (or off) all force options.
<P>
<B>downgrade</B>(*):
Install a package, even if newer version of it is already installed.
<P>
<I>Warning: At present </I><B>dpkg</B><I> does not do any dependency
checking on downgrades and therefore will not warn you
if the downgrade breaks the dependency of some other
package. This can have serious side effects, downgrading
essential system components can even make your whole
system unusable. Use with care.</I>
<P>
<B>configure-any</B>:
Configure also any unpacked but unconfigured packages on which the current
package depends.
<P>
<B>hold</B>:
Process packages even when marked "hold".
<P>
<B>remove-reinstreq</B>:
Remove a package, even if it's broken and marked to require
reinstallation. This may, for example, cause parts of the package to
remain on the system, which will then be forgotten by <B>dpkg</B>.
<P>
<B>remove-essential</B>:
Remove, even if the package is considered essential. Essential
packages contain mostly very basic Unix commands. Removing them might
cause the whole system to stop working, so use with caution.
<P>
<B>depends</B>:
Turn all dependency problems into warnings.
This affects the <B>Pre-Depends</B> and <B>Depends</B> fields.
<P>
<B>depends-version</B>:
Don't care about versions when checking dependencies.
This affects the <B>Pre-Depends</B> and <B>Depends</B> fields.
<P>
<B>breaks</B>:
Install, even if this would break another package (since dpkg 1.14.6).
This affects the <B>Breaks</B> field.
<P>
<B>conflicts</B>:
Install, even if it conflicts with another package. This is dangerous,
for it will usually cause overwriting of some files.
This affects the <B>Conflicts</B> field.
<P>
<B>confmiss</B>:
Always install the missing conffile without prompting. This is dangerous,
since it means not preserving a change (removing) made to the file.
<P>
<B>confnew</B>:
If a conffile has been modified and the version in the package did change,
always install the new version without prompting, unless the
<B>--force-confdef</B> is also specified, in which case the default
action is preferred.
<P>
<B>confold</B>:
If a conffile has been modified and the version in the package did change,
always keep the old version without prompting, unless the
<B>--force-confdef</B> is also specified, in which case the default
action is preferred.
<P>
<B>confdef</B>:
If a conffile has been modified and the version in the package did change,
always choose the default action without prompting. If there is no default
action it will stop to ask the user unless <B>--force-confnew</B> or
<B>--force-confold</B> is also been given, in which case it will use
that to decide the final action.
<P>
<B>confask</B>:
If a conffile has been modified always offer to replace it with the
version in the package, even if the version in the package did not
change (since dpkg 1.15.8).
If any of <B>--force-confnew</B>,
<B>--force-confold</B>, or <B>--force-confdef</B> is also given,
it will be used to decide the final action.
<P>
<B>overwrite</B>:
Overwrite one package's file with another's file.
<P>
<B>overwrite-dir</B>:
Overwrite one package's directory with another's file.
<P>
<B>overwrite-diverted</B>:
Overwrite a diverted file with an undiverted version.
<P>
<B>statoverride-add</B>:
Overwrite an existing stat override when adding it (since dpkg 1.19.5).
<P>
<B>statoverride-remove</B>:
Ignore a missing stat override when removing it (since dpkg 1.19.5).
<P>
<B>security-mac</B>(*):
Use platform-specific Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) based security when
installing files into the filesystem (since dpkg 1.19.5).
On Linux systems the implementation uses SELinux.
<P>
<B>unsafe-io</B>:
Do not perform safe I/O operations when unpacking (since dpkg 1.15.8.6).
Currently this
implies not performing file system syncs before file renames, which is
known to cause substantial performance degradation on some file systems,
unfortunately the ones that require the safe I/O on the first place due
to their unreliable behaviour causing zero-length files on abrupt
system crashes.
<P>
<I>Note</I>: For ext4, the main offender, consider using instead the
mount option <B>nodelalloc</B>, which will fix both the performance
degradation and the data safety issues, the latter by making the file
system not produce zero-length files on abrupt system crashes with
any software not doing syncs before atomic renames.
<P>
<I>Warning: Using this option might improve performance at the cost of
losing data, use with care.</I>
<P>
<B>script-chrootless</B>:
Run maintainer scripts without <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+chroot">chroot</A></B>(2)ing into <B>instdir</B> even
if the package does not support this mode of operation (since dpkg 1.18.5).
<P>
<I>Warning: This can destroy your host system, use with extreme care.</I>
<P>
<B>architecture</B>:
Process even packages with wrong or no architecture.
<P>
<B>bad-version</B>:
Process even packages with wrong versions (since dpkg 1.16.1).
<P>
<B>bad-path</B>:
<B>PATH</B> is missing important programs, so problems are likely.
<P>
<B>not-root</B>:
Try to (de)install things even when not root.
<P>
<B>bad-verify</B>:
Install a package even if it fails authenticity check.
<P>
<DT id="66"><B>--ignore-depends</B>=<I>package</I>,...<DD>
Ignore dependency-checking for specified packages (actually, checking is
performed, but only warnings about conflicts are given, nothing else).
This affects the <B>Pre-Depends</B>, <B>Depends</B> and <B>Breaks</B> fields.
<DT id="67"><B>--no-act</B>, <B>--dry-run</B>, <B>--simulate</B><DD>
Do everything which is supposed to be done, but don't write any
changes. This is used to see what would happen with the specified
action, without actually modifying anything.
<P>
Be sure to give <B>--no-act</B> before the action-parameter, or you might
end up with undesirable results. (e.g. <B>dpkg --purge foo
--no-act</B> will first purge package foo and then try to purge package
--no-act, even though you probably expected it to actually do nothing)
<DT id="68"><B>-R</B>, <B>--recursive</B><DD>
Recursively handle all regular files matching pattern <B>*.deb</B>
found at specified directories and all of its subdirectories. This can
be used with <B>-i</B>, <B>-A</B>, <B>--install</B>, <B>--unpack</B> and
<B>--record-avail</B> actions.
<DT id="69"><B>-G</B><DD>
Don't install a package if a newer version of the same package is already
installed. This is an alias of <B>--refuse-downgrade</B>.
<DT id="70"><B>--admindir=</B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Set the administrative directory to <I>directory</I>.
This directory contains many files that give information about status of
installed or uninstalled packages, etc.
Defaults to &laquo;<I>/var/lib/dpkg</I>&raquo;.
<DT id="71"><B>--instdir=</B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory where
packages are to be installed. <B>instdir</B> is also the directory passed
to <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+chroot">chroot</A></B>(2) before running package's installation scripts, which
means that the scripts see <B>instdir</B> as a root directory.
Defaults to &laquo;<I>/</I>&raquo;.
<DT id="72"><B>--root=</B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Set the root directory to <B>directory</B>, which sets the installation
directory to &laquo;<I>dir</I>&raquo; and the administrative
directory to &laquo;<I>dir</I><B>/var/lib/dpkg</B>&raquo;.
<DT id="73"><B>-O</B>, <B>--selected-only</B><DD>
Only process the packages that are selected for installation. The
actual marking is done with <B>dselect</B> or by <B>dpkg</B>, when it
handles packages. For example, when a package is removed, it will
be marked selected for deinstallation.
<DT id="74"><B>-E</B>, <B>--skip-same-version</B>

<DD>
Don't install the package if the same version of the package is already
installed.
<DT id="75"><B>--pre-invoke=</B><I>command</I>

<DD>

<B>--post-invoke=</B><I>command</I>

Set an invoke hook <I>command</I> to be run via ``sh -c'' before or
after the <B>dpkg</B> run for the <I>unpack</I>, <I>configure</I>, <I>install</I>,
<I>triggers-only</I>, <I>remove</I>, <I>purge</I>, <I>add-architecture</I> and
<I>remove-architecture</I> <B>dpkg</B> actions (since dpkg 1.15.4;
<I>add-architecture</I> and <I>remove-architecture</I> actions
since dpkg 1.17.19). This
option can be specified multiple times. The order the options are specified
is preserved, with the ones from the configuration files taking precedence.
The environment variable <B>DPKG_HOOK_ACTION</B> is set for the hooks to the
current <B>dpkg</B> action. Note: front-ends might call <B>dpkg</B> several
times per invocation, which might run the hooks more times than expected.
<DT id="76"><B>--path-exclude=</B><I>glob-pattern</I>

<DD>

<B>--path-include=</B><I>glob-pattern</I>

Set <I>glob-pattern</I> as a path filter, either by excluding or re-including
previously excluded paths matching the specified patterns during install
(since dpkg 1.15.8).
<P>
<I>Warning: take into account that depending on the excluded paths you
might completely break your system, use with caution.</I>
<P>
The glob patterns use the same wildcards used in the shell, were
'*' matches any sequence of characters, including the empty string
and also '/'.
For example, &laquo;<I>/usr/*/READ*</I>&raquo; matches
&laquo;<I>/usr/share/doc/package/README</I>&raquo;.
As usual, '?' matches any single character (again, including '/').
And '['
starts a character class, which can contain a list of characters, ranges
and complementations. See <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+glob">glob</A></B>(7) for detailed information about
globbing. Note: the current implementation might re-include more directories
and symlinks than needed, to be on the safe side and avoid possible unpack
failures; future work might fix this.
<P>
This can be used to remove all paths except some particular ones; a typical
case is:
<P>
<PRE>
<B>--path-exclude=/usr/share/doc/*</B>
<B>--path-include=/usr/share/doc/*/copyright</B>
</PRE>

<P>
to remove all documentation files except the copyright files.
<P>
These two options can be specified multiple times, and interleaved with
each other. Both are processed in the given order, with the last rule that
matches a file name making the decision.
<P>
The filters are applied when unpacking the binary packages, and as such
only have knowledge of the type of object currently being filtered
(e.g. a normal file or a directory) and have not visibility of what
objects will come next.
Because these filters have side effects (in contrast to <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+find">find</A></B>(1)
filters), excluding an exact pathname that happens to be a directory object
like <I>/usr/share/doc</I> will not have the desired result, and only that
pathname will be excluded (which could be automatically reincluded if the
code sees the need).
Any subsequent files contained within that directory will fail to unpack.
<P>
Hint: make sure the globs are not expanded by your shell.
<DT id="77"><B>--verify-format</B><I> format-name</I>

<DD>
Sets the output format for the <B>--verify</B> command (since dpkg 1.17.2).
<P>
The only currently supported output format is <B>rpm</B>, which consists
of a line for every path that failed any check.
The lines start with 9 characters to report each specific check result,
a '<B>?</B>' implies the check could not be done (lack of support,
file permissions, etc), '<B>.</B>' implies the check passed, and
an alphanumeric character implies a specific check failed; the md5sum
verification failure (the file contents have changed) is denoted with
a '<B>5</B>' on the third character.
The line is followed by a space and an attribute character (currently
'<B>c</B>' for conffiles), another space and the pathname.
<DT id="78"><B>--status-fd </B><I>n</I><DD>
Send machine-readable package status and progress information to file
descriptor <I>n</I>. This option can be specified multiple times. The
information is generally one record per line, in one of the following
forms:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="79"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="80"><B>status: </B><I>package</I><B>: </B><I>status</I>

<DD>
Package status changed; <I>status</I> is as in the status file.
<DT id="81"><B>status: </B><I>package</I><B> : error : </B><I>extended-error-message</I>

<DD>
An error occurred. Any possible newlines in <I>extended-error-message</I>
will be converted to spaces before output.
<DT id="82"><B>status: </B><I>file</I><B> : conffile-prompt : '</B><I>real-old</I><B>' '</B><I>real-new</I><B>' </B><I>useredited</I><B> </B><I>distedited</I>

<DD>
User is being asked a conffile question.
<DT id="83"><B>processing: </B><I>stage</I><B>: </B><I>package</I>

<DD>
Sent just before a processing stage starts. <I>stage</I> is one of
<B>upgrade</B>, <B>install</B> (both sent before unpacking),

<B>configure</B>, <B>trigproc</B>, <B>disappear</B>, <B>remove</B>, <B>purge</B>.

</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="84"><B>--status-logger</B>=<I>command</I><DD>
Send machine-readable package status and progress information to the
shell <I>command</I>'s standard input, to be run via ``sh -c''
(since dpkg 1.16.0).
This option can be specified multiple times.
The output format used is the same as in <B>--status-fd</B>.
<DT id="85"><B>--log=</B><I>filename</I><DD>
Log status change updates and actions to <I>filename</I>, instead of
the default <I>/var/log/dpkg.log</I>. If this option is given multiple
times, the last filename is used. Log messages are of the form:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="86"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="87">YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <B>startup</B> <I>type</I> <I>command</I><DD>
For each dpkg invocation where <I>type</I> is <B>archives</B> (with a

<DT id="88">YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <B>status</B> <I>state</I> <I>pkg</I> <I>installed-version</I><DD>
For status change updates.
<DT id="89">YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <I>action</I> <I>pkg</I> <I>installed-version</I> <I>available-version</I><DD>
For actions where <I>action</I> is one of <B>install</B>, <B>upgrade</B>,
<B>configure</B>, <B>trigproc</B>, <B>disappear</B>, <B>remove</B> or <B>purge</B>.
<DT id="90">YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <B>conffile</B> <I>filename</I> <I>decision</I><DD>

<B>keep</B>.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT id="91"><B>--no-pager</B>

<DD>

<DT id="92"><B>--no-debsig</B><DD>
Do not try to verify package signatures.
<DT id="93"><B>--no-triggers</B><DD>
Do not run any triggers in this run (since dpkg 1.14.17), but activations
will still be recorded.
If used with <B>--configure</B> <I>package</I> or
<B>--triggers-only</B> <I>package</I> then the named package postinst
will still be run even if only a triggers run is needed. Use of this option
may leave packages in the improper <B>triggers-awaited</B> and
<B>triggers-pending</B> states. This can be fixed later by running:
<B>dpkg --configure --pending</B>.
<DT id="94"><B>--triggers</B><DD>
Cancels a previous <B>--no-triggers</B> (since dpkg 1.14.17).

whether a package is marked for removing or not, whether it is
installed or not, etc. See section <B>INFORMATION ABOUT PACKAGES</B>
for more info.
<P>
The status file is backed up daily in <I>/var/backups</I>. It can be
useful if it's lost or corrupted due to filesystems troubles.

<P>

The format and contents of a binary package are described in <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+deb">deb</A></B>(5).

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

To list installed packages related to the editor <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+vi">vi</A></B>(1) (note that
<B>dpkg-query</B> does not load the <I>available</I> file anymore by
default, and the <B>dpkg-query</B> <B>--load-avail</B> option should
be used instead for that):
<BR>

<B>     dpkg -l '*vi*'</B>
<BR>

<P>
To see the entries in <I>/var/lib/dpkg/available</I> of two packages:
<BR>

<B>     dpkg --print-avail elvis vim | less</B>
<BR>

<P>
To search the listing of packages yourself:
<BR>

<B>     less /var/lib/dpkg/available</B>
<BR>

<P>
To remove an installed elvis package:
<BR>

<B>     dpkg -r elvis</B>
<BR>

<P>
To install a package, you first need to find it in an archive or
CDROM. The <I>available</I> file shows that the vim package is in section
<B>editors</B>:
<BR>

<B>     cd /media/cdrom/pool/main/v/vim</B>
<B>     dpkg -i vim_4.5-3.deb</B>
<BR>

<P>
To make a local copy of the package selection states:
<BR>

<B>     dpkg --get-selections &gt;myselections</B>
<BR>

<P>
You might transfer this file to another computer, and after having updated
the <I>available</I> file there with your package manager frontend of choice
(see <A HREF="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ">https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg/FAQ</A> for more details), for example:
<BR>

<B>     apt-cache dumpavail | dpkg --merge-avail</B>
<BR>

or with dpkg 1.17.6 and earlier:
<BR>

<B>     avail=`mktemp`</B>
<B>     apt-cache dumpavail &gt;&quot;$avail&quot;</B>
<B>     dpkg --merge-avail &quot;$avail&quot;</B>
<B>     rm &quot;$avail&quot;</B>
<BR>

you can install it with:
<BR>

<B>     dpkg --clear-selections</B>
<B>     dpkg --set-selections &lt;myselections</B>
<BR>

<P>
Note that this will not actually install or remove anything, but just
set the selection state on the requested packages. You will need some
other application to actually download and install the requested
packages. For example, run <B>apt-get dselect-upgrade</B>.
<P>
Ordinarily, you will find that <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dselect">dselect</A></B>(1) provides a more
convenient way to modify the package selection states.
