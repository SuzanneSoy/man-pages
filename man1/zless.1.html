zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>Zless</I>

is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files
one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the equivalent of
setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq -- %s',
and the environment variable LESSMETACHARS to
'&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;;*?&quot;()&lt;&gt;[|&amp;^`#\$%=~',
and then running
<I>less</I>.

However, enough people seem to think that having the
command
<I>zless</I>

available is important to be worth providing it.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<I>Zless</I>

does not work with compressed data that is piped to it via standard
input; it requires that input files be specified as arguments.
To read compressed data from a pipe, you can use
...<B>|gunzip|less</B>

instead of
...<B>|zless</B>.
