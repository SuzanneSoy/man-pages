<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This manual page documents briefly the <B>dfu-tool</B> command.
<P>

<B>dfu-tool</B> allows a user to write various kinds of
firmware onto devices supporting the USB Device Firmware Upgrade protocol.
This tool can be used to switch the device from the normal runtime mode
to `DFU mode' which allows the user to read and write firmware.
Either the whole device can be written in one operation, or individual
`targets' can be specified with the alternative name or number.
<P>

<B>dfu-tool</B> uses the libdfu shared
library to perform actions.
All synchronous actions can be safely cancelled and on failure will return
errors with both a type and a full textual description.
libdfu supports DFU 1.0, DFU 1.1 and the ST DfuSe vendor extension, and
handles many device `quirks' necessary for the real-world implementations
of DFU.
<P>

Additionally <B>dfu-tool</B> can be used to convert firmware
from various different formats, or to modify details about the elements,
images and metadata contained inside the firmware file.
For example, you can easily convert DFU 1.1 firmware into the
vendor-specific DfuSe format, convert a Intel HEX file into a raw file
padded to a specific size, or add new copyright and licensing information
to an existing file.
Fields such as the vendor and product IDs can be changed, and the firmware
elements can be encrypted and decrypted using various different methods.
Merging two DfuSe files together is also possible, although specifying
different alt-setting numbers before merging is a good idea to avoid
confusion.
<P>

Although <B>dfu-tool</B> tries to provide a large number of
easy-to-use commands, it may only be possible to do certain operations
using the libdfu library directly.
This is easier than it sounds, as the library is built with GObject
Introspection support making it usable in many languages such as C,
Javascript and Python.
Furthermore, using the library is a good idea if you want to perform
multiple operations on large firmware files, for instance,
converting from an Intel HEX file, padding to a certain size, setting
vendor and adding licensing information and then saving to a remote
location.
