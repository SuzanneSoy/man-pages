Produces a portable graymap as output.
<P>

This program is obsoleted by 
<B>pstopnm</B>.

What follows was written before 
<B>pstopnm </B>

existed.
<P>
This is a very simple and limited program, and is here only because
so many people have asked for it.
To use it you have to
<B>manually</B>

extract the readhexstring data portion from your PostScript file, and then
give the width, height, and bits/sample on the command line.
Before you attempt this, you should
<B>at least</B>

read the description of the &quot;image&quot; operator in the PostScript Language
Reference Manual.
<P>

It would probably not be too hard to write a script that uses this filter
to read a specific variety of PostScript image, but the variation is too
great to make a general-purpose reader.
Unless, of course, you want to write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...
