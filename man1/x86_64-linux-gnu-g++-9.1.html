Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  <B>g++</B> accepts mostly the same options as <B>gcc</B>.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



When you invoke <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The ``overall options'' allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <B>-c</B> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
<P>

Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
<P>

Most of the command-line options that you can use with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
<P>

The usual way to run <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is to run the executable called <B>gcc</B>, or
<I>machine</I><B>-gcc</B> when cross-compiling, or
<I>machine</I><B>-gcc-</B><I>version</I> to run a specific version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
When you compile C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs, you should invoke <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> as <B>g++</B> 
instead.
<P>

The <B>gcc</B> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <I>not</I> be grouped: <B>-dv</B> is very different from <B>-d&nbsp;-v</B>.
<P>

You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify <B>-L</B> more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the <B>-l</B> option is significant.
<P>

Many options have long names starting with <B>-f</B> or with
<B>-W</B>---for example,
<B>-fmove-loop-invariants</B>, <B>-Wformat</B> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<B>-ffoo</B> is <B>-fno-foo</B>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.
<P>

Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either
by a space or by the equals sign (<B>=</B>) from the option name.
Unless documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or
a string.  Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal
or hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal arguments must begin with
the <B>0x</B> prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a size
threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large decimal or hexadecimal
integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a multiple of bytes
such as <TT>&quot;kB&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;KiB&quot;</TT> for kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively,
<TT>&quot;MB&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;MiB&quot;</TT> for megabyte and mebibyte, <TT>&quot;GB&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;GiB&quot;</TT> for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on.  Such arguments are
designated by <I>byte-size</I> in the following text.  Refer to the <FONT SIZE="-1">NIST,
IEC,</FONT> and other relevant national and international standards for the full
listing and explanation of the binary and decimal byte size prefixes.

<H3>Options Controlling the Kind of Output</H3>



Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
<P>

For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

</DL>
<P>

You can specify the input language explicitly with the <B>-x</B> option:

<DT id="72"><B>-x</B> <I>language</I><DD>


Specify explicitly the <I>language</I> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file

the next <B>-x</B> option.  Possible values for <I>language</I> are:


<P>




<PRE>
        c  c-header  cpp-output
        c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output

        go
        brig

</PRE>


<DT id="73"><B>-x none</B><DD>


Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <B>-x</B>
has not been used at all).
</DL>
<P>

If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<B>-x</B> (or filename suffixes) to tell <B>gcc</B> where to start, and
one of the options <B>-c</B>, <B>-S</B>, or <B>-E</B> to say where
<B>gcc</B> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<B>-x cpp-output -E</B>) instruct <B>gcc</B> to do nothing at all.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="74"><B>-c</B><DD>


Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.


<P>


By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <B>.c</B>, <B>.i</B>, <B>.s</B>, etc., with <B>.o</B>.


<P>


Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
<DT id="75"><B>-S</B><DD>


Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.


<P>


By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <B>.c</B>, <B>.i</B>, etc., with <B>.s</B>.


<P>


Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
<DT id="76"><B>-E</B><DD>


Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.


<P>


Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.
<DT id="77"><B>-o</B> <I>file</I><DD>


Place output in file <I>file</I>.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.


<P>


If <B>-o</B> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in <I>a.out</I>, the object file for
<I>source.suffix</I> in <I>source.o</I>, its
assembler file in <I>source.s</I>, a precompiled header file in
<I>source.suffix.gch</I>, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.
<DT id="78"><B>-v</B><DD>


Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
<DT id="79"><B>-###</B><DD>


Like <B>-v</B> except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or <TT>&quot;./-_&quot;</TT>.
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.
<DT id="80"><B>--help</B><DD>


Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by <B>gcc</B>.  If the <B>-v</B> option is also specified
then <B>--help</B> is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by <B>gcc</B>, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the <B>-Wextra</B> option has also been specified
(prior to the <B>--help</B> option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them are also displayed.
<DT id="81"><B>--target-help</B><DD>


Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line
options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.
<DT id="82"><B>--help={</B><I>class</I>|[<B>^</B>]<I>qualifier</I><B>}</B>[<B>,...</B>]<DD>


Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="83"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="84"><B>optimizers</B><DD>


Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.
<DT id="85"><B>warnings</B><DD>


Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.
<DT id="86"><B>target</B><DD>


Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
<B>--target-help</B> option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended <B>--help=</B> syntax.
<DT id="87"><B>params</B><DD>


Display the values recognized by the <B>--param</B>
option.
<DT id="88"><I>language</I><DD>


Display the options supported for <I>language</I>, where
<I>language</I> is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
<DT id="89"><B>common</B><DD>


Display the options that are common to all languages.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="90"><DD>


<P>


These are the supported qualifiers:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="91"><B>undocumented</B><DD>


Display only those options that are undocumented.
<DT id="92"><B>joined</B><DD>


Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
<B>--help=target</B>.
<DT id="93"><B>separate</B><DD>


Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: <B>-o output-file</B>.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="94"><DD>


<P>


Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use:


<P>




<PRE>
        --help=target,undocumented

</PRE>




<P>


The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
<B>^</B> character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:


<P>




<PRE>
        --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented

</PRE>




<P>


The argument to <B>--help=</B> should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.


<P>


Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
<I>target</I>.  For example, to display all the target-specific
optimization options, use:


<P>




<PRE>
        --help=target,optimizers

</PRE>




<P>


The <B>--help=</B> option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.  If <B>--help</B> is also
specified anywhere on the command line then this takes precedence
over any <B>--help=</B> option.


<P>


If the <B>-Q</B> option appears on the command line before the
<B>--help=</B> option, then the descriptive text displayed by
<B>--help=</B> is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the <B>--help=</B> option is used).


<P>


Here is a truncated example from the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> port of <B>gcc</B>:


<P>




<PRE>
          % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
          The following options are target specific:
          -mabi=                                2
          -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
          -mapcs                                [disabled]

</PRE>




<P>


The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at <B>-O2</B> by using:


<P>




<PRE>
        -Q -O2 --help=optimizers

</PRE>




<P>


Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by <B>-O3</B> by using:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts
        gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts
        diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled

</PRE>


</DL>

<DT id="95"><B>--version</B><DD>


Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
<DT id="96"><B>-pass-exit-codes</B><DD>


Normally the <B>gcc</B> program exits with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<B>-pass-exit-codes</B>, the <B>gcc</B> program instead returns with
the numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
indication.  The C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an internal
compiler error is encountered.
<DT id="97"><B>-pipe</B><DD>


Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> assembler has
no trouble.
<DT id="98"><B>-specs=</B><I>file</I><DD>


Process <I>file</I> after the compiler reads in the standard <I>specs</I>
file, in order to override the defaults which the <B>gcc</B> driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to <B>cc1</B>,
<B>cc1plus</B>, <B>as</B>, <B>ld</B>, etc.  More than one
<B>-specs=</B><I>file</I> can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
<DT id="99"><B>-wrapper</B><DD>


Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of the
wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma separated
list.


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args

</PRE>




<P>


This invokes all subprograms of <B>gcc</B> under
<B>gdb --args</B>, thus the invocation of <B>cc1</B> is
<B>gdb --args cc1 ...</B>.
<DT id="100"><B>-ffile-prefix-map=</B><I>old</I><B>=</B><I>new</I><DD>


When compiling files residing in directory <I>old</I>, record
any references to them in the result of the compilation as if the
files resided in directory <I>new</I> instead.  Specifying this
option is equivalent to specifying all the individual
<B>-f*-prefix-map</B> options.  This can be used to make reproducible

<DT id="101"><B>-fplugin=</B><I>name</I><B>.so</B><DD>


Load the plugin code in file <I>name</I>.so, assumed to be a
shared object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.  The base name of
the shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the
purposes of argument parsing (See
<B>-fplugin-arg-</B><I>name</I><B>-</B><I>key</I><B>=</B><I>value</I> below).
Each plugin should define the callback functions specified in the

<DT id="105"><B>-fdump-go-spec=</B><I>file</I><DD>


For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
declarations in <I>file</I>.  This generates Go <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;type&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;var&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;func&quot;</TT> declarations which may be a
useful way to start writing a Go interface to code written in some
other language.
<DT id="106"><B>@</B><I>file</I><DD>


Read command-line options from <I>file</I>.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @<I>file</I> option.  If <I>file</I>
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.


<P>


Options in <I>file</I> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The <I>file</I> may itself contain additional
@<I>file</I> options; any such options will be processed recursively.

<H3>Compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Programs</H3>



C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <B>.C</B>,
<B>.cc</B>, <B>.cpp</B>, <B>.CPP</B>, <B>.c++</B>, <B>.cp</B>, or
<B>.cxx</B>; C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> header files often use <B>.hh</B>, <B>.hpp</B>,
<B>.H</B>, or (for shared template code) <B>.tcc</B>; and
preprocessed C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> files use the suffix <B>.ii</B>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name <B>gcc</B>).
<P>

However, the use of <B>gcc</B> does not add the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.
<B>g++</B> is a program that calls <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> and automatically specifies linking
against the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.  It treats <B>.c</B>,
<B>.h</B> and <B>.i</B> files as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> source files instead of C source
files unless <B>-x</B> is used.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a <B>.h</B> extension for use in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
compilations.  On many systems, <B>g++</B> is also installed with
the name <B>c++</B>.
<P>

When you compile C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Options Controlling C Dialect</H3>



The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>) that the compiler
accepts:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="107"><B>-ansi</B><DD>


In C mode, this is equivalent to <B>-std=c90</B>. In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> mode, it is
equivalent to <B>-std=c++98</B>.


<P>


This turns off certain features of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> that are incompatible with <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO
C90</FONT> (when compiling C code), or of standard C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> (when compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> code),
such as the <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <TT>&quot;unix&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;vax&quot;</TT> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> style <B>//</B> comments as well as
the <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> keyword.


<P>


The alternate keywords <TT>&quot;__asm__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__extension__&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;__inline__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT> continue to work despite
<B>-ansi</B>.  You would not want to use them in an <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <B>-ansi</B>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <TT>&quot;__unix__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__vax__&quot;</TT> are also available, with or
without <B>-ansi</B>.


<P>


The <B>-ansi</B> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <B>-Wpedantic</B> is required in
addition to <B>-ansi</B>.


<P>


The macro <TT>&quot;__STRICT_ANSI__&quot;</TT> is predefined when the <B>-ansi</B>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.


<P>


Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> (such as <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;ffs&quot;</TT>) are not built-in
functions when <B>-ansi</B> is used.
<DT id="108"><B>-std=</B><DD>


Determine the language standard.   This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


The compiler can accept several base standards, such as <B>c90</B> or
<B>c++98</B>, and <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> dialects of those standards, such as
<B>gnu90</B> or <B>gnu++98</B>.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
<B>-std=c90</B> turns off certain features of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> that are
incompatible with <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90,</FONT> such as the <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT>
keywords, but not other <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions that do not have a meaning in
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90,</FONT> such as omitting the middle term of a <TT>&quot;?:&quot;</TT>
expression. On the other hand, when a <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by <B>-Wpedantic</B> to identify which features are <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
<B>-std=gnu90 -Wpedantic</B> warns about C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> style <B>//</B>
comments, while <B>-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic</B> does not.

<DT id="154"><B>-fgnu89-inline</B><DD>


The option <B>-fgnu89-inline</B> tells <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use the traditional
<FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> semantics for <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> functions when in C99 mode.


<P>


Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
<TT>&quot;gnu_inline&quot;</TT> function attribute to all inline functions.


<P>


The option <B>-fno-gnu89-inline</B> explicitly tells <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use the
C99 semantics for <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior).
This option is not supported in <B>-std=c90</B> or
<B>-std=gnu90</B> mode.


<P>


The preprocessor macros <TT>&quot;__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__&quot;</TT> may be used to check which semantics are
in effect for <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> functions.
<DT id="155"><B>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=</B><I>style</I><DD>


<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO/IEC TS 18661-3</FONT> defines new permissible values for
<TT>&quot;FLT_EVAL_METHOD&quot;</TT> that indicate that operations and constants with
a semantic type that is an interchange or extended format should be
evaluated to the precision and range of that type.  These new values are
a superset of those permitted under C99/C11, which does not specify the
meaning of other positive values of <TT>&quot;FLT_EVAL_METHOD&quot;</TT>.  As such, code
conforming to C11 may not have been written expecting the possibility of
the new values.


<P>


<B>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods</B> specifies whether the compiler
should allow only the values of <TT>&quot;FLT_EVAL_METHOD&quot;</TT> specified in C99/C11,
or the extended set of values specified in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO/IEC TS 18661-3.</FONT>


<P>


<I>style</I> is either <TT>&quot;c11&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;ts-18661-3&quot;</TT> as appropriate.


<P>


The default when in a standards compliant mode (<B>-std=c11</B> or similar)
is <B>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=c11</B>.  The default when in a <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>

<B>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=ts-18661-3</B>.
<DT id="156"><B>-aux-info</B> <I>filename</I><DD>


Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.


<P>


Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<B>I</B>, <B>N</B> for new or
<B>O</B> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (<B>C</B> or <B>F</B>, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.
<DT id="157"><B>-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions</B><DD>


Accept variadic functions without named parameters.


<P>


Although it is possible to define such a function, this is not very
useful as it is not possible to read the arguments.  This is only
supported for C as this construct is allowed by C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT id="158"><B>-fno-asm</B><DD>


Do not recognize <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <TT>&quot;__asm__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__inline__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT>
instead.  <B>-ansi</B> implies <B>-fno-asm</B>.


<P>


In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, this switch only affects the <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keyword, since
<TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <B>-fno-gnu-keywords</B> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<B>-std=c99</B> or <B>-std=gnu99</B>), this
switch only affects the <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> keywords, since
<TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT> is a standard keyword in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99.</FONT>
<DT id="159"><B>-fno-builtin</B><DD>



<DT id="160"><B>-fno-builtin-</B><I>function</I><DD>



Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
<B>__builtin_</B> as prefix.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with <B>-Wformat</B> for bad calls to
<TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> when <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> is built in and <TT>&quot;strlen&quot;</TT> is
known not to modify global memory.


<P>


With the <B>-fno-builtin-</B><I>function</I> option
only the built-in function <I>function</I> is
disabled.  <I>function</I> must not begin with <B>__builtin_</B>.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<B>-fbuiltin-</B><I>function</I> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <B>-fno-builtin</B> or
<B>-ffreestanding</B>, you may define macros such as:

<DT id="162"><B>-fhosted</B><DD>


Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment.  This implies
<B>-fbuiltin</B>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> has a return
type of <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to <B>-fno-freestanding</B>.
<DT id="163"><B>-ffreestanding</B><DD>


Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.  This
implies <B>-fno-builtin</B>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>.  The most obvious example is an <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> kernel.
This is equivalent to <B>-fno-hosted</B>.

compiler generates accelerated code according to the OpenACC Application
Programming Interface v2.0 &lt;<B><A HREF="https://www.openacc.org">https://www.openacc.org</A></B>&gt;.  This option
implies <B>-pthread</B>, and thus is only supported on targets that

compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v4.5 &lt;<B><A HREF="https://www.openmp.org">https://www.openmp.org</A></B>&gt;.  This option
implies <B>-pthread</B>, and thus is only supported on targets that
have support for <B>-pthread</B>. <B>-fopenmp</B> implies
<B>-fopenmp-simd</B>.
<DT id="167"><B>-fopenmp-simd</B><DD>


Enable handling of OpenMP's <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> directives with <TT>&quot;#pragma omp&quot;</TT>
in C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and <TT>&quot;!$omp&quot;</TT> in Fortran. Other OpenMP directives
are ignored.
<DT id="168"><B>-fgnu-tm</B><DD>


When the option <B>-fgnu-tm</B> is specified, the compiler
generates code for the Linux variant of Intel's current Transactional
Memory <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).  This is
an experimental feature whose interface may change in future versions

This enables <B>-fms-extensions</B>, permits passing pointers to
structures with anonymous fields to functions that expect pointers to
elements of the type of the field, and permits referring to anonymous
fields declared using a typedef.    This is only
supported for C, not C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT id="171"><B>-fcond-mismatch</B><DD>


Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT id="172"><B>-flax-vector-conversions</B><DD>


Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of
elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should not be
used for new code.
<DT id="173"><B>-funsigned-char</B><DD>


Let the type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> be unsigned, like <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Each kind of machine has a default for what <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> should
be.  It is either like <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT> by default or like
<TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> by default.


<P>


Ideally, a portable program should always use <TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.


<P>


The type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> is always a distinct type from each of
<TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;unsigned char&quot;</TT>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
<DT id="174"><B>-fsigned-char</B><DD>


Let the type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> be signed, like <TT>&quot;signed char&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Note that this is equivalent to <B>-fno-unsigned-char</B>, which is
the negative form of <B>-funsigned-char</B>.  Likewise, the option
<B>-fno-signed-char</B> is equivalent to <B>-funsigned-char</B>.
<DT id="175"><B>-fsigned-bitfields</B><DD>



<DT id="176"><B>-funsigned-bitfields</B><DD>


<DT id="177"><B>-fno-signed-bitfields</B><DD>


<DT id="178"><B>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</B><DD>



These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <TT>&quot;signed&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;unsigned&quot;</TT>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> are signed types.
<DT id="179"><B>-fsso-struct=</B><I>endianness</I><DD>


Set the default scalar storage order of structures and unions to the
specified endianness.  The accepted values are <B>big-endian</B>,
<B>little-endian</B> and <B>native</B> for the native endianness of
the target (the default).  This option is not supported for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fsso-struct</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without it if the
specified endianness is not the native endianness of the target.

<H3>Options Controlling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialect</H3>



This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.  You can also use most of the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <I>firstClass.C</I> like this:
<P>



<PRE>
        g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C

</PRE>


<P>

In this example, only <B>-fstrict-enums</B> is an option meant
only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
<P>

Some options for compiling C programs, such as <B>-std</B>, are also
relevant for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.
<P>

Here is a list of options that are <I>only</I> for compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="180"><B>-fabi-version=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Use version <I>n</I> of the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  The default is version 0.


<P>


Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> specification.  Therefore, the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> bugs are fixed.


<P>


Version 1 is the version of the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> that first appeared in G++ 3.2.


<P>


Version 2 is the version of the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> that first appeared in G++
3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.


<P>


Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.


<P>


Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.


<P>


Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.


<P>


Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and --, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.


<P>


Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a
builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument
scope.


<P>


Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution
behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.


<P>


Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
<TT>&quot;nullptr_t&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of
attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling convention
attributes (e.g. <B>stdcall</B>).


<P>


Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of
sizeof... expressions and operator names.  For multiple entities with
the same name within a function, that are declared in different scopes,
the mangling now changes starting with the twelfth occurrence.  It also
implies <B>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</B>.


<P>


Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the calling
conventions for empty classes on the x86_64 target and for classes
with only deleted copy/move constructors.  It accidentally changes the
calling convention for classes with a deleted copy constructor and a
trivial move constructor.


<P>


Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the accidental
change in version 12.


<P>


See also <B>-Wabi</B>.
<DT id="181"><B>-fabi-compat-version=</B><I>n</I><DD>


On targets that support strong aliases, G++
works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name.
This switch specifies which <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> version to use for the alias.


<P>


With <B>-fabi-version=0</B> (the default), this defaults to 11 (<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 7</FONT>
compatibility).  If another <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> version is explicitly selected, this
defaults to 0.  For compatibility with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> versions 3.2 through 4.9,
use <B>-fabi-compat-version=2</B>.


<P>


If this option is not provided but <B>-Wabi=</B><I>n</I> is, that
version is used for compatibility aliases.  If this option is provided
along with <B>-Wabi</B> (without the version), the version from this
option is used for the warning.
<DT id="182"><B>-fno-access-control</B><DD>


Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
<DT id="183"><B>-faligned-new</B><DD>


Enable support for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17 <TT>&quot;new&quot;</TT> of types that require more
alignment than <TT>&quot;void* ::operator new(std::size_t)&quot;</TT> provides.  A
numeric argument such as <TT>&quot;-faligned-new=32&quot;</TT> can be used to
specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that function,
but few users will need to override the default of
<TT>&quot;alignof(std::max_align_t)&quot;</TT>.


<P>


This flag is enabled by default for <B>-std=c++17</B>.
<DT id="184"><B>-fchar8_t</B><DD>



<DT id="185"><B>-fno-char8_t</B><DD>



Enable support for <TT>&quot;char8_t&quot;</TT> as adopted for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>2a.  This includes
the addition of a new <TT>&quot;char8_t&quot;</TT> fundamental type, changes to the
types of <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> string and character literals, new signatures for
user-defined literals, associated standard library updates, and new
<TT>&quot;__cpp_char8_t&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__cpp_lib_char8_t&quot;</TT> feature test macros.


<P>


This option enables functions to be overloaded for ordinary and <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>
strings:


<P>




<PRE>
        int f(const char *);    // #1
        int f(const char8_t *); // #2
        int v1 = f(&quot;text&quot;);     // Calls #1
        int v2 = f(u8&quot;text&quot;);   // Calls #2

</PRE>




<P>


and introduces new signatures for user-defined literals:


<P>




<PRE>
        int operator&quot;&quot;_udl1(char8_t);
        int v3 = u8'x'_udl1;
        int operator&quot;&quot;_udl2(const char8_t*, std::size_t);
        int v4 = u8&quot;text&quot;_udl2;
        template&lt;typename T, T...&gt; int operator&quot;&quot;_udl3();
        int v5 = u8&quot;text&quot;_udl3;

</PRE>




<P>


The change to the types of <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> string and character literals introduces
incompatibilities with <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11</FONT> and later standards.  For example, the
following code is well-formed under <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11,</FONT> but is ill-formed when
<B>-fchar8_t</B> is specified.


<P>




<PRE>
        char ca[] = u8&quot;xx&quot;;     // error: char-array initialized from wide
                                //        string
        const char *cp = u8&quot;xx&quot;;// error: invalid conversion from
                                //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
        int f(const char*);
        auto v = f(u8&quot;xx&quot;);     // error: invalid conversion from
                                //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
        std::string s{u8&quot;xx&quot;};  // error: no matching function for call to
                                //        `std::basic_string&lt;char&gt;::basic_string()'
        using namespace std::literals;
        s = u8&quot;xx&quot;s;            // error: conversion from
                                //        `basic_string&lt;char8_t&gt;' to non-scalar
                                //        type `basic_string&lt;char&gt;' requested

</PRE>


<DT id="186"><B>-fcheck-new</B><DD>


Check that the pointer returned by <TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard specifies that
<TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> only returns <TT>0</TT> if it is declared
<TT>&quot;throw()&quot;</TT>, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <TT>&quot;std::bad_alloc&quot;</TT>.  See also
<B>new (nothrow)</B>.
<DT id="187"><B>-fconcepts</B><DD>


Enable support for the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Extensions for Concepts Technical
Specification, <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO 19217</FONT> (2015), which allows code like


<P>




<PRE>
        template &lt;class T&gt; concept bool Addable = requires (T t) { t + t; };
        template &lt;Addable T&gt; T add (T a, T b) { return a + b; }

</PRE>


<DT id="188"><B>-fconstexpr-depth=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 constexpr functions
to <I>n</I>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.
<DT id="189"><B>-fconstexpr-loop-limit=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Set the maximum number of iterations for a loop in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>14 constexpr functions
to <I>n</I>.  A limit is needed to detect infinite loops during
constant expression evaluation.  The default is 262144 (1&lt;&lt;18).
<DT id="190"><B>-fconstexpr-ops-limit=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Set the maximum number of operations during a single constexpr evaluation.
Even when number of iterations of a single loop is limited with the above limit,
if there are several nested loops and each of them has many iterations but still
smaller than the above limit, or if in a body of some loop or even outside
of a loop too many expressions need to be evaluated, the resulting constexpr
evaluation might take too long.
The default is 33554432 (1&lt;&lt;25).
<DT id="191"><B>-fdeduce-init-list</B><DD>


Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
<TT>&quot;std::initializer_list&quot;</TT> from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.


<P>




<PRE>
        template &lt;class T&gt; auto forward(T t) -&gt; decltype (realfn (t))
        {
          return realfn (t);
        }
        
        void f()
        {
          forward({1,2}); // call forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.
<DT id="192"><B>-fno-elide-constructors</B><DD>


The C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.  This option also causes G++
to call trivial member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.


<P>


In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this
option still affects trivial member functions.
<DT id="193"><B>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</B><DD>


Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<TT>&quot;NDEBUG&quot;</TT>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.
<DT id="194"><B>-fextern-tls-init</B><DD>



<DT id="195"><B>-fno-extern-tls-init</B><DD>



The C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 and OpenMP standards allow <TT>&quot;thread_local&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;threadprivate&quot;</TT> variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization.
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining <FONT SIZE="-1">TU</FONT> needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining <FONT SIZE="-1">TU</FONT> will be executed before any uses in
another <FONT SIZE="-1">TU</FONT>), they can avoid this overhead with the
<B>-fno-extern-tls-init</B> option.


<P>


On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
<B>-fextern-tls-init</B>.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is <B>-fno-extern-tls-init</B>.
<DT id="196"><B>-fno-gnu-keywords</B><DD>


Do not recognize <TT>&quot;typeof&quot;</TT> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <TT>&quot;__typeof__&quot;</TT> instead.
This option is implied by the strict <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></FONT> dialects: <B>-ansi</B>,
<B>-std=c++98</B>, <B>-std=c++11</B>, etc.
<DT id="197"><B>-fno-implicit-templates</B><DD>


Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
If you use this option, you must take care to structure your code to
include all the necessary explicit instantiations to avoid getting
undefined symbols at link time.
<DT id="198"><B>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</B><DD>


Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization need the same set of explicit instantiations.
<DT id="199"><B>-fno-implement-inlines</B><DD>


To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <TT>&quot;#pragma implementation&quot;</TT>.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
<DT id="200"><B>-fms-extensions</B><DD>


Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in <FONT SIZE="-1">MFC,</FONT> such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.
<DT id="201"><B>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</B><DD>


Enable the P0136 adjustment to the semantics of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 constructor
inheritance.  This is part of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17 but also considered to be a Defect
Report against C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>14.  This flag is enabled by default
unless <B>-fabi-version=10</B> or lower is specified.
<DT id="202"><B>-fnew-ttp-matching</B><DD>


Enable the P0522 resolution to Core issue 150, template template
parameters and default arguments: this allows a template with default
template arguments as an argument for a template template parameter
with fewer template parameters.  This flag is enabled by default for
<B>-std=c++17</B>.
<DT id="203"><B>-fno-nonansi-builtins</B><DD>


Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
<FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI/ISO C.</FONT>  These include <TT>&quot;ffs&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;_exit&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;index&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bzero&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;conjf&quot;</TT>, and other related functions.
<DT id="204"><B>-fnothrow-opt</B><DD>


Treat a <TT>&quot;throw()&quot;</TT> exception specification as if it were a
<TT>&quot;noexcept&quot;</TT> specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the <FONT SIZE="-1">EH</FONT> cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to <TT>&quot;terminate&quot;</TT> rather than <TT>&quot;unexpected&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="205"><B>-fno-operator-names</B><DD>


Do not treat the operator name keywords <TT>&quot;and&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bitand&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;bitor&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;compl&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;not&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;or&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;xor&quot;</TT> as
synonyms as keywords.
<DT id="206"><B>-fno-optional-diags</B><DD>


Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
<DT id="207"><B>-fpermissive</B><DD>


Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <B>-fpermissive</B> allows some
nonconforming code to compile.
<DT id="208"><B>-fno-pretty-templates</B><DD>


When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. <TT>&quot;void f(T) [with T = int]&quot;</TT>
rather than <TT>&quot;void f(int)&quot;</TT>) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use <B>-fno-pretty-templates</B> to disable them.
<DT id="209"><B>-frepo</B><DD>


Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <B>-fno-implicit-templates</B>.
<DT id="210"><B>-fno-rtti</B><DD>


Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> run-time type identification features
(<TT>&quot;dynamic_cast&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;typeid&quot;</TT>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The <TT>&quot;dynamic_cast&quot;</TT> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to <TT>&quot;void *&quot;</TT> or to
unambiguous base classes.


<P>


Mixing code compiled with <B>-frtti</B> with that compiled with
<B>-fno-rtti</B> may not work.  For example, programs may
fail to link if a class compiled with <B>-fno-rtti</B> is used as a base 
for a class compiled with <B>-frtti</B>.
<DT id="211"><B>-fsized-deallocation</B><DD>


Enable the built-in global declarations


<P>




<PRE>
        void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
        void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;

</PRE>




<P>


as introduced in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>14.  This is useful for user-defined replacement
deallocation functions that, for example, use the size of the object
to make deallocation faster.  Enabled by default under
<B>-std=c++14</B> and above.  The flag <B>-Wsized-deallocation</B>
warns about places that might want to add a definition.
<DT id="212"><B>-fstrict-enums</B><DD>


Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.
<DT id="213"><B>-fstrong-eval-order</B><DD>


Evaluate member access, array subscripting, and shift expressions in
left-to-right order, and evaluate assignment in right-to-left order,
as adopted for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17.  Enabled by default with <B>-std=c++17</B>.
<B>-fstrong-eval-order=some</B> enables just the ordering of member
access and shift expressions, and is the default without
<B>-std=c++17</B>.
<DT id="214"><B>-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single
warning or error to <I>n</I>.  The default value is 10.
<DT id="215"><B>-ftemplate-depth=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <I>n</I>.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  <FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI/ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></FONT>
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.
<DT id="216"><B>-fno-threadsafe-statics</B><DD>


Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.
<DT id="217"><B>-fuse-cxa-atexit</B><DD>


Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<TT>&quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;</TT> function rather than the <TT>&quot;atexit&quot;</TT> function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
<TT>&quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="218"><B>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr</B><DD>


Don't use the <TT>&quot;__cxa_get_exception_ptr&quot;</TT> runtime routine.  This
causes <TT>&quot;std::uncaught_exception&quot;</TT> to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
<DT id="219"><B>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</B><DD>


This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.


<P>


The effect of this is that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<TT>&quot;__attribute__ ((visibility (&quot;hidden&quot;)))&quot;</TT> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO</FONT> and do not require a <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> indirection
when used within the <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO.</FONT>  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO</FONT> as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.


<P>


The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.


<P>


You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.


<P>


Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
<DT id="220"><B>-fvisibility-ms-compat</B><DD>


This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.


<P>


The flag makes these changes to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s linkage model:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="221"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="222">1.<DD>


It sets the default visibility to <TT>&quot;hidden&quot;</TT>, like
<B>-fvisibility=hidden</B>.
<DT id="223">2.<DD>


Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
<DT id="224">3.<DD>


The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="225"><DD>


<P>


In new code it is better to use <B>-fvisibility=hidden</B> and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.


<P>


Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ODR</FONT> to define types with the same name differently.
</DL>

<DT id="226"><B>-fno-weak</B><DD>


Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
<DT id="227"><B>-nostdinc++</B><DD>


Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.)
</DL>
<P>

In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="228"><B>-Wabi</B> (C, Objective-C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when G++ it generates code that is probably not compatible with
the vendor-neutral C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  Since G++ now defaults to updating the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> with each major release, normally <B>-Wabi</B> will warn only if
there is a check added later in a release series for an <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> issue
discovered since the initial release.  <B>-Wabi</B> will warn about
more things if an older <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> version is selected (with
<B>-fabi-version=</B><I>n</I>).


<P>


<B>-Wabi</B> can also be used with an explicit version number to
warn about compatibility with a particular <B>-fabi-version</B>
level, e.g. <B>-Wabi=2</B> to warn about changes relative to
<B>-fabi-version=2</B>.


<P>


If an explicit version number is provided and
<B>-fabi-compat-version</B> is not specified, the version number
from this option is used for compatibility aliases.  If no explicit
version number is provided with this option, but
<B>-fabi-compat-version</B> is specified, that version number is
used for <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> warnings.


<P>


Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.


<P>


You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.


<P>


Known incompatibilities in <B>-fabi-version=2</B> (which was the

<DL COMPACT><DT id="229"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="230">*<DD>
A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type was
mangled incorrectly:


<P>

        template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};
        void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}

<P>


This was fixed in <B>-fabi-version=3</B>.
<DT id="231">*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> vector types declared using <TT>&quot;__attribute ((vector_size))&quot;</TT> were
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of

<P>


The mangling was changed in <B>-fabi-version=4</B>.
<DT id="232">*<DD>
<TT>&quot;__attribute ((const))&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT> were mangled as type
qualifiers, and <TT>&quot;decltype&quot;</TT> of a plain declaration was folded away.


<P>


These mangling issues were fixed in <B>-fabi-version=5</B>.
<DT id="233">*<DD>
Scoped enumerators passed as arguments to a variadic function are
promoted like unscoped enumerators, causing <TT>&quot;va_arg&quot;</TT> to complain.
On most targets this does not actually affect the parameter passing
<FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> as there is no way to pass an argument smaller than <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Also, the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> changed the mangling of template argument packs,
<TT>&quot;const_cast&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;static_cast&quot;</TT>, prefix increment/decrement, and
a class scope function used as a template argument.


<P>


These issues were corrected in <B>-fabi-version=6</B>.
<DT id="234">*<DD>
Lambdas in default argument scope were mangled incorrectly, and the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> changed the mangling of <TT>&quot;nullptr_t&quot;</TT>.


<P>


These issues were corrected in <B>-fabi-version=7</B>.
<DT id="235">*<DD>
When mangling a function type with function-cv-qualifiers, the
un-qualified function type was incorrectly treated as a substitution
candidate.


<P>


This was fixed in <B>-fabi-version=8</B>, the default for <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 5.1.</FONT>
<DT id="236">*<DD>
<TT>&quot;decltype(nullptr)&quot;</TT> incorrectly had an alignment of 1, leading to
unaligned accesses.  Note that this did not affect the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> of a
function with a <TT>&quot;nullptr_t&quot;</TT> parameter, as parameters have a
minimum alignment.


<P>


This was fixed in <B>-fabi-version=9</B>, the default for <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 5.2.</FONT>
<DT id="237">*<DD>
Target-specific attributes that affect the identity of a type, such as
ia32 calling conventions on a function type (stdcall, regparm, etc.),
did not affect the mangled name, leading to name collisions when
function pointers were used as template arguments.

This was fixed in <B>-fabi-version=10</B>, the default for <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 6.1.</FONT>

<DT id="241"><B>-Wabi-tag</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a type with an <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> tag is used in a context that does not
have that <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> tag.  See <B>C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Attributes</B> for more information

<DT id="242"><B>-Wctor-dtor-privacy</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends nor
public static member functions.  Also warn if there are no non-private
methods, and there's at least one private member function that isn't
a constructor or destructor.
<DT id="243"><B>-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when <TT>&quot;delete&quot;</TT> is used to destroy an instance of a class that
has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor. It is unsafe to delete
an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base class if the
base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled
by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="244"><B>-Wdeprecated-copy</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn that the implicit declaration of a copy constructor or copy
assignment operator is deprecated if the class has a user-provided
copy constructor or copy assignment operator, in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 and up.  This
warning is enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.  With
<B>-Wdeprecated-copy-dtor</B>, also deprecate if the class has a
user-provided destructor.
<DT id="245"><B>-Wno-init-list-lifetime</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Do not warn about uses of <TT>&quot;std::initializer_list&quot;</TT> that are likely
to result in dangling pointers.  Since the underlying array for an
<TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT> is handled like a normal C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> temporary object,
it is easy to inadvertently keep a pointer to the array past the end
of the array's lifetime.  For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="246"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="247">*<DD>
If a function returns a temporary <TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT>, or a local
<TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT> variable, the array's lifetime ends at the end
of the return statement, so the value returned has a dangling pointer.
<DT id="248">*<DD>
If a new-expression creates an <TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT>, the array only
lives until the end of the enclosing full-expression, so the
<TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT> in the heap has a dangling pointer.
<DT id="249">*<DD>
When an <TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT> variable is assigned from a
brace-enclosed initializer list, the temporary array created for the
right side of the assignment only lives until the end of the
full-expression, so at the next statement the <TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT>
variable has a dangling pointer.


<P>




<PRE>
        // li's initial underlying array lives as long as li
        std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; li = { 1,2,3 };
        // assignment changes li to point to a temporary array
        li = { 4, 5 };
        // now the temporary is gone and li has a dangling pointer
        int i = li.begin()[0] // undefined behavior

</PRE>


<DT id="250">*<DD>
When a list constructor stores the <TT>&quot;begin&quot;</TT> pointer from the
<TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT> argument, this doesn't extend the lifetime of
the array, so if a class variable is constructed from a temporary
<TT>&quot;initializer_list&quot;</TT>, the pointer is left dangling by the end of
the variable declaration statement.

<DT id="252"><B>-Wliteral-suffix</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does
not begin with an underscore.  As a conforming extension, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> treats such
suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from <TT>&quot;&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/inttypes.h">inttypes.h</A>&gt;&quot;</TT>.
For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        #define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
        #include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/inttypes.h">inttypes.h</A>&gt;
        #include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</A>&gt;
        
        int main() {
          int64_t i64 = 123;
          printf(&quot;My int64: %&quot; PRId64&quot;\n&quot;, i64);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


In this case, <TT>&quot;PRId64&quot;</TT> is treated as a separate preprocessing token.


<P>


Additionally, warn when a user-defined literal operator is declared with
a literal suffix identifier that doesn't begin with an underscore. Literal
suffix identifiers that don't begin with an underscore are reserved for
future standardization.


<P>


This warning is enabled by default.
<DT id="253"><B>-Wlto-type-mismatch</B><DD>

<DT id="254"><B>-Wno-narrowing</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


For C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 and later standards, narrowing conversions are diagnosed by default,
as required by the standard.  A narrowing conversion from a constant produces
an error, and a narrowing conversion from a non-constant produces a warning,
but <B>-Wno-narrowing</B> suppresses the diagnostic.
Note that this does not affect the meaning of well-formed code;
narrowing conversions are still considered ill-formed in <FONT SIZE="-1">SFINAE</FONT> contexts.


<P>


With <B>-Wnarrowing</B> in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>98, warn when a narrowing
conversion prohibited by C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 occurs within
<B>{ }</B>, e.g.


<P>




<PRE>
        int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int

<P>


This flag is included in <B>-Wall</B> and <B>-Wc++11-compat</B>.
<DT id="255"><B>-Wnoexcept</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call
to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception
specification (i.e. <TT>&quot;throw()&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;noexcept&quot;</TT>) but is known by
the compiler to never throw an exception.
<DT id="256"><B>-Wnoexcept-type</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17 feature making <TT>&quot;noexcept&quot;</TT> part of a function
type changes the mangled name of a symbol relative to C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>14.  Enabled
by <B>-Wabi</B> and <B>-Wc++17-compat</B>.


<P>


As an example:


<P>




<PRE>
        template &lt;class T&gt; void f(T t) { t(); };
        void g() noexcept;
        void h() { f(g); }

</PRE>




<P>


In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>14, <TT>&quot;f&quot;</TT> calls <TT>&quot;f&lt;void(*)()&gt;&quot;</TT>, but in
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17 it calls <TT>&quot;f&lt;void(*)()noexcept&gt;&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="257"><B>-Wclass-memaccess</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when the destination of a call to a raw memory function such as
<TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> is an object of class type, and when writing
into such an object might bypass the class non-trivial or deleted constructor
or copy assignment, violate const-correctness or encapsulation, or corrupt
virtual table pointers.  Modifying the representation of such objects may
violate invariants maintained by member functions of the class.  For example,
the call to <TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT> below is undefined because it modifies a non-trivial
class object and is, therefore, diagnosed.  The safe way to either initialize
or clear the storage of objects of such types is by using the appropriate
constructor or assignment operator, if one is available.


<P>




<PRE>
        std::string str = &quot;abc&quot;;
        memset (&amp;str, 0, sizeof str);

</PRE>




<P>


The <B>-Wclass-memaccess</B> option is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
Explicitly casting the pointer to the class object to <TT>&quot;void *&quot;</TT> or
to a type that can be safely accessed by the raw memory function suppresses
the warning.
<DT id="258"><B>-Wnon-virtual-dtor</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual
destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic base class, in which
case it is possible but unsafe to delete an instance of a derived
class through a pointer to the class itself or base class.  This
warning is automatically enabled if <B>-Weffc++</B> is specified.
<DT id="259"><B>-Wregister</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn on uses of the <TT>&quot;register&quot;</TT> storage class specifier, except
when it is part of the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> <B>Explicit Register Variables</B> extension.
The use of the <TT>&quot;register&quot;</TT> keyword as storage class specifier has
been deprecated in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 and removed in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17.
Enabled by default with <B>-std=c++17</B>.
<DT id="260"><B>-Wreorder</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A {
          int i;
          int j;
          A(): j (0), i (1) { }
        };

</PRE>




<P>


The compiler rearranges the member initializers for <TT>&quot;i&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;j&quot;</TT> to match the declaration order of the members, emitting
a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="261"><B>-Wno-pessimizing-move</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


This warning warns when a call to <TT>&quot;std::move&quot;</TT> prevents copy
elision.  A typical scenario when copy elision can occur is when returning in
a function with a class return type, when the expression being returned is the
name of a non-volatile automatic object, and is not a function parameter, and
has the same type as the function return type.


<P>




<PRE>
        struct T {
        ...
        };
        T fn()
        {
          T t;
          ...
          return std::move (t);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


But in this example, the <TT>&quot;std::move&quot;</TT> call prevents copy elision.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="262"><B>-Wno-redundant-move</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


This warning warns about redundant calls to <TT>&quot;std::move&quot;</TT>; that is, when
a move operation would have been performed even without the <TT>&quot;std::move&quot;</TT>
call.  This happens because the compiler is forced to treat the object as if
it were an rvalue in certain situations such as returning a local variable,
where copy elision isn't applicable.  Consider:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct T {
        ...
        };
        T fn(T t)
        {
          ...
          return std::move (t);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


Here, the <TT>&quot;std::move&quot;</TT> call is redundant.  Because G++ implements Core
Issue 1579, another example is:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct T { // convertible to U
        ...
        };
        struct U {
        ...
        };
        U fn()
        {
          T t;
          ...
          return std::move (t);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


In this example, copy elision isn't applicable because the type of the
expression being returned and the function return type differ, yet G++
treats the return value as if it were designated by an rvalue.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.

<DT id="273"><B>-Wstrict-null-sentinel</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn about the use of an uncasted <TT>&quot;NULL&quot;</TT> as sentinel.  When
compiling only with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> this is a valid sentinel, as <TT>&quot;NULL&quot;</TT> is defined
to <TT>&quot;__null&quot;</TT>.  Although it is a null pointer constant rather than a
null pointer, it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer.
But this use is not portable across different compilers.
<DT id="274"><B>-Wno-non-template-friend</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Disable warnings when non-template friend functions are declared
within a template.  In very old versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> that predate implementation
of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> standard, declarations such as 
<B>friend int foo(int)</B>, where the name of the friend is an unqualified-id,
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a template
function; the warning exists to diagnose compatibility problems, 
and is enabled by default.
<DT id="275"><B>-Wold-style-cast</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> program.  The new-style casts (<TT>&quot;dynamic_cast&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;static_cast&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;reinterpret_cast&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;const_cast&quot;</TT>) are
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.
<DT id="276"><B>-Woverloaded-virtual</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct A {
          virtual void f();
        };
        
        struct B: public A {
          void f(int);
        };

</PRE>




<P>


the <TT>&quot;A&quot;</TT> class version of <TT>&quot;f&quot;</TT> is hidden in <TT>&quot;B&quot;</TT>, and code
like:


<P>




<PRE>
        B* b;
        b-&gt;f();

</PRE>




<P>


fails to compile.
<DT id="277"><B>-Wno-pmf-conversions</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.
<DT id="278"><B>-Wsign-promo</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ tried to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
<DT id="279"><B>-Wtemplates</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a primary template declaration is encountered.  Some coding
rules disallow templates, and this may be used to enforce that rule.
The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as the <FONT SIZE="-1">STL,</FONT> so
one can still use the <FONT SIZE="-1">STL.</FONT>  One may also instantiate or specialize
templates.
<DT id="280"><B>-Wmultiple-inheritance</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a class is defined with multiple direct base classes.  Some
coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to
enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file,
such as the <FONT SIZE="-1">STL,</FONT> so one can still use the <FONT SIZE="-1">STL.</FONT>  One may also define
classes that indirectly use multiple inheritance.
<DT id="281"><B>-Wvirtual-inheritance</B><DD>


Warn when a class is defined with a virtual direct base class.  Some
coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to
enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file,
such as the <FONT SIZE="-1">STL,</FONT> so one can still use the <FONT SIZE="-1">STL.</FONT>  One may also define
classes that indirectly use virtual inheritance.
<DT id="282"><B>-Wnamespaces</B><DD>


Warn when a namespace definition is opened.  Some coding rules disallow
namespaces, and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is
inactive inside a system header file, such as the <FONT SIZE="-1">STL,</FONT> so one can still
use the <FONT SIZE="-1">STL.</FONT>  One may also use using directives and qualified names.
<DT id="283"><B>-Wno-terminate</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Disable the warning about a throw-expression that will immediately
result in a call to <TT>&quot;terminate&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="284"><B>-Wno-class-conversion</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Disable the warning about the case when a conversion function converts an
object to the same type, to a base class of that type, or to void; such
a conversion function will never be called.

<H3>Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialects</H3>



(<FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
languages themselves.
<P>

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.  You can also use most of
the language-independent <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file <I>some_class.m</I> like this:
<P>



<PRE>
        gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m

</PRE>


<P>

In this example, <B>-fgnu-runtime</B> is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
<P>

Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
<B>-Wtraditional</B>).  Similarly, Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> compilations may use
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>-specific options (e.g., <B>-Wabi</B>).
<P>

Here is a list of options that are <I>only</I> for compiling Objective-C
and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="285"><B>-fconstant-string-class=</B><I>class-name</I><DD>


Use <I>class-name</I> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax <TT>&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT>.  The default
class name is <TT>&quot;NXConstantString&quot;</TT> if the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> runtime is being used, and
<TT>&quot;NSConstantString&quot;</TT> if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
<B>-fconstant-cfstrings</B> option, if also present, overrides the
<B>-fconstant-string-class</B> setting and cause <TT>&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT> literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
<DT id="286"><B>-fgnu-runtime</B><DD>


Generate object code compatible with the standard <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
<DT id="287"><B>-fnext-runtime</B><DD>


Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS X.</FONT>  The macro
<TT>&quot;__NEXT_RUNTIME__&quot;</TT> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
<DT id="288"><B>-fno-nil-receivers</B><DD>


Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (<TT>&quot;[receiver
message:arg]&quot;</TT>) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
not <TT>&quot;nil&quot;</TT>.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
runtime to be used.  This option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime and <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> version 0 or 1.
<DT id="289"><B>-fobjc-abi-version=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Use version <I>n</I> of the Objective-C <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> for the selected runtime.
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32-bit) <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target machines.
<DT id="290"><B>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors</B><DD>


For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special <TT>&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot;</TT> instance method which runs
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return <TT>&quot;self&quot;</TT>.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special <TT>&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;</TT> method which runs
all such default destructors, in reverse order.


<P>


The <TT>&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;</TT>
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The <TT>&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot;</TT> methods are invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the <TT>&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;</TT> methods are invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.


<P>


As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS X 10.4</FONT> and later has
support for invoking the <TT>&quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;</TT> methods.
<DT id="291"><B>-fobjc-direct-dispatch</B><DD>


Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.
<DT id="292"><B>-fobjc-exceptions</B><DD>


Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords <TT>@try</TT>,
<TT>@throw</TT>, <TT>@catch</TT>, <TT>@finally</TT> and
<TT>@synchronized</TT>.  This option is available with both the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS X 10.2</FONT> and earlier).
<DT id="293"><B>-fobjc-gc</B><DD>


Enable garbage collection (<FONT SIZE="-1">GC</FONT>) in Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
<FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.
<DT id="294"><B>-fobjc-nilcheck</B><DD>


For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> check for a nil
receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call.
This is the default and can be disabled using
<B>-fno-objc-nilcheck</B>.  Class methods and super calls are never
checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to.
Currently this flag does nothing when the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> runtime, or an older
version of the NeXT runtime <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> is used.
<DT id="295"><B>-fobjc-std=objc1</B><DD>


Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
recognized by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 4.0.</FONT>  This only affects the Objective-C additions to
the C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> language; it does not affect conformance to C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standards,
which is controlled by the separate C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> dialect option flags.  When
this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 4.0</FONT> is rejected.
This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can
be compiled with older versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
<DT id="296"><B>-freplace-objc-classes</B><DD>


Emit a special marker instructing <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+ld">ld</A>(1)</B> not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+dyld">dyld</A>(1)</B> to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS X 10.3</FONT>
and later.
<DT id="297"><B>-fzero-link</B><DD>


When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to <TT>&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</TT> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the <B>-fzero-link</B> flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <TT>&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</TT>
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
The <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> runtime currently always retains calls to <TT>&quot;objc_get_class(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</TT>
regardless of command-line options.
<DT id="298"><B>-fno-local-ivars</B><DD>


By default instance variables in Objective-C can be accessed as if
they were local variables from within the methods of the class they're
declared in.  This can lead to shadowing between instance variables
and other variables declared either locally inside a class method or
globally with the same name.  Specifying the <B>-fno-local-ivars</B>
flag disables this behavior thus avoiding variable shadowing issues.
<DT id="299"><B>-fivar-visibility=</B>[<B>public</B>|<B>protected</B>|<B>private</B>|<B>package</B>]<DD>


Set the default instance variable visibility to the specified option
so that instance variables declared outside the scope of any access
modifier directives default to the specified visibility.
<DT id="300"><B>-gen-decls</B><DD>


Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named <I>sourcename.decl</I>.
<DT id="301"><B>-Wassign-intercept</B> (Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.
<DT id="302"><B>-Wno-protocol</B> (Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the <B>-Wno-protocol</B> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
<DT id="303"><B>-Wselector</B> (Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT>
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the <B>-fsyntax-only</B> option is
being used.
<DT id="304"><B>-Wstrict-selector-match</B> (Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type <TT>&quot;id&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;Class&quot;</TT>.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size
and alignment.
<DT id="305"><B>-Wundeclared-selector</B> (Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
<TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression, either explicitly in an
<TT>@interface</TT> or <TT>@protocol</TT> declaration, or implicitly in
an <TT>@implementation</TT> section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a <TT>&quot;@selector(...)&quot;</TT> expression is found,
while <B>-Wselector</B> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.
<DT id="306"><B>-print-objc-runtime-info</B><DD>


Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by
value, if any.

<H3>Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting</H3>



Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  You can use the
options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, 
e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="307"><B>-fmessage-length=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about
<I>n</I> characters.  If <I>n</I> is zero, then no line-wrapping is
done; each error message appears on a single line.  This is the
default for all front ends.


<P>


Note - this option also affects the display of the <B>#error</B> and
<B>#warning</B> pre-processor directives, and the <B>deprecated</B>
function/type/variable attribute.  It does not however affect the
<B>pragma </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC</B></FONT><B> warning</B> and <B>pragma </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC</B></FONT><B> error</B> pragmas.
<DT id="308"><B>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</B><DD>


Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information <I>once</I>; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
<DT id="309"><B>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</B><DD>


Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
<DT id="310"><B>-fdiagnostics-color[=</B><I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>WHEN</I></FONT><I></I><B>]</B><DD>



<DT id="311"><B>-fno-diagnostics-color</B><DD>



Use color in diagnostics.  <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>WHEN</I></FONT><I></I> is <B>never</B>, <B>always</B>,
or <B>auto</B>.  The default depends on how the compiler has been configured,
it can be any of the above <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>WHEN</I></FONT><I></I> options or also <B>never</B>
if <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COLORS</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable isn't present in the environment,
and <B>auto</B> otherwise.
<B>auto</B> means to use color only when the standard error is a terminal.
The forms <B>-fdiagnostics-color</B> and <B>-fno-diagnostics-color</B> are
aliases for <B>-fdiagnostics-color=always</B> and
<B>-fdiagnostics-color=never</B>, respectively.


<P>


The colors are defined by the environment variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COLORS</B></FONT><B></B>.
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic
Rendition (<FONT SIZE="-1">SGR</FONT>) substrings. <FONT SIZE="-1">SGR</FONT> commands are interpreted by the
terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the documentation
of your text terminal for permitted values and their meanings as
character attributes.)  These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.
Common values to concatenate include
<B>1</B> for bold,
<B>4</B> for underline,
<B>5</B> for blink,
<B>7</B> for inverse,
<B>39</B> for default foreground color,
<B>30</B> to <B>37</B> for foreground colors,
<B>90</B> to <B>97</B> for 16-color mode foreground colors,
<B>38;5;0</B> to <B>38;5;255</B>
for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors,
<B>49</B> for default background color,
<B>40</B> to <B>47</B> for background colors,
<B>100</B> to <B>107</B> for 16-color mode background colors,
and <B>48;5;0</B> to <B>48;5;255</B>
for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

<DT id="328"><B>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</B><DD>


By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the
command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an
option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
<B>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</B> flag suppresses that behavior.
<DT id="329"><B>-fno-diagnostics-show-caret</B><DD>


By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original source line
and a caret <B>^</B> indicating the column.  This option suppresses this
information.  The source line is truncated to <I>n</I> characters, if
the <B>-fmessage-length=n</B> option is given.  When the output is done

                          char *         long int

</PRE>




<P>


This option suppresses the printing of these labels (in the example above,
the vertical bars and the ``char *'' and ``long int'' text).
<DT id="331"><B>-fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers</B><DD>


By default, when printing source code (via <B>-fdiagnostics-show-caret</B>),
a left margin is printed, showing line numbers.  This option suppresses this
left margin.
<DT id="332"><B>-fdiagnostics-minimum-margin-width=</B><I>width</I><DD>


This option controls the minimum width of the left margin printed by
<B>-fdiagnostics-show-line-numbers</B>.  It defaults to 6.
<DT id="333"><B>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</B><DD>


Emit fix-it hints in a machine-parseable format, suitable for consumption
by IDEs.  For each fix-it, a line will be printed after the relevant
diagnostic, starting with the string ``fix-it:''.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        fix-it:&quot;test.c&quot;:{45:3-45:21}:&quot;gtk_widget_show_all&quot;

</PRE>




<P>


The location is expressed as a half-open range, expressed as a count of
bytes, starting at byte 1 for the initial column.  In the above example,
bytes 3 through 20 of line 45 of ``test.c'' are to be replaced with the
given string:


<P>




<PRE>
        00000000011111111112222222222
        12345678901234567890123456789
          gtk_widget_showall (dlg);
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          gtk_widget_show_all

</PRE>




<P>


The filename and replacement string escape backslash as ``\\'', tab as ``\t'',
newline as ``\n'', double quotes as ``\''``, non-printable characters as octal
(e.g. vertical tab as ''\013&quot;).


<P>


An empty replacement string indicates that the given range is to be removed.
An empty range (e.g. ``45:3-45:3'') indicates that the string is to
be inserted at the given position.
<DT id="334"><B>-fdiagnostics-generate-patch</B><DD>


Print fix-it hints to stderr in unified diff format, after any diagnostics
are printed.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        --- test.c
        +++ test.c
        @ -42,5 +42,5 @
        
         void show_cb(GtkDialog *dlg)
         {
        -  gtk_widget_showall(dlg);
        +  gtk_widget_show_all(dlg);
         }

</PRE>




<P>


The diff may or may not be colorized, following the same rules
as for diagnostics (see <B>-fdiagnostics-color</B>).
<DT id="335"><B>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</B><DD>


In the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> frontend, when printing diagnostics showing mismatching
template types, such as:


<P>




<PRE>
          could not convert 'std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;()'
            from 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;' to 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;

</PRE>




<P>


the <B>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</B> flag enables printing a
tree-like structure showing the common and differing parts of the types,
such as:


<P>




<PRE>
          map&lt;
            [...],
            vector&lt;
              [double != float]&gt;&gt;

</PRE>




<P>


The parts that differ are highlighted with color (``double'' and
``float'' in this case).
<DT id="336"><B>-fno-elide-type</B><DD>


By default when the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> frontend prints diagnostics showing mismatching
template types, common parts of the types are printed as ``[...]'' to
simplify the error message.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
          could not convert 'std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;()'
            from 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;' to 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;

</PRE>




<P>


Specifying the <B>-fno-elide-type</B> flag suppresses that behavior.
This flag also affects the output of the
<B>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</B> flag.
<DT id="337"><B>-fno-show-column</B><DD>


Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if
diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the
column numbers, such as <B>dejagnu</B>.
<DT id="338"><B>-fdiagnostics-format=</B><I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>FORMAT</I></FONT><I></I><DD>


Select a different format for printing diagnostics.
<I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>FORMAT</I></FONT><I></I> is <B>text</B> or <B>json</B>.
The default is <B>text</B>.


<P>


The <B>json</B> format consists of a top-level <FONT SIZE="-1">JSON</FONT> array containing <FONT SIZE="-1">JSON</FONT>
objects representing the diagnostics.


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">JSON</FONT> is emitted as one line, without formatting; the examples below
have been formatted for clarity.


<P>


Diagnostics can have child diagnostics.  For example, this error and note:


<P>




<PRE>

          guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]

<P>


A diagnostic has a <TT>&quot;kind&quot;</TT>.  If this is <TT>&quot;warning&quot;</TT>, then there is
an <TT>&quot;option&quot;</TT> key describing the command-line option controlling the

<P>


A diagnostic can contain zero or more locations.  Each location has up
to three positions within it: a <TT>&quot;caret&quot;</TT> position and optional
<TT>&quot;start&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;finish&quot;</TT> positions.  A location can also have
an optional <TT>&quot;label&quot;</TT> string.  For example, this error:

<H3>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</H3>



Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
<P>

The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="339"><B>-fsyntax-only</B><DD>


Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
<DT id="340"><B>-fmax-errors=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Limits the maximum number of error messages to <I>n</I>, at which point
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <I>n</I> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <B>-Wfatal-errors</B> is also
specified, then <B>-Wfatal-errors</B> takes precedence over this
option.
<DT id="341"><B>-w</B><DD>


Inhibit all warning messages.
<DT id="342"><B>-Werror</B><DD>


Make all warnings into errors.
<DT id="343"><B>-Werror=</B><DD>


Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <B>-Werror=switch</B> turns the warnings
controlled by <B>-Wswitch</B> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <B>-Werror</B> for specific
warnings; for example <B>-Wno-error=switch</B> makes
<B>-Wswitch</B> warnings not be errors, even when <B>-Werror</B>
is in effect.


<P>


The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<B>-Werror=</B> and <B>-Wno-error=</B> as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<B>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</B> flag.)


<P>


Note that specifying <B>-Werror=</B><I>foo</I> automatically implies
<B>-W</B><I>foo</I>.  However, <B>-Wno-error=</B><I>foo</I> does not
imply anything.
<DT id="344"><B>-Wfatal-errors</B><DD>


This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
</DL>
<P>

You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
<B>-W</B>, for example <B>-Wimplicit</B> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning <B>-Wno-</B> to turn off warnings; for
example, <B>-Wno-implicit</B>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <B>C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialect Options</B> and
<B>Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialect Options</B>.
<P>

Some options, such as <B>-Wall</B> and <B>-Wextra</B>, turn on other
options, such as <B>-Wunused</B>, which may turn on further options,
such as <B>-Wunused-value</B>. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.
<P>

When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<B>-Wunknown-warning</B>), <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <B>-Wno-</B> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <B>-Wno-unknown-warning</B> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <B>-Wno-</B> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.
<P>

The effectiveness of some warnings depends on optimizations also being
enabled. For example <B>-Wsuggest-final-types</B> is more effective
with link-time optimization and <B>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</B> will not
warn at all unless optimization is enabled.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="345"><B>-Wpedantic</B><DD>



<DT id="346"><B>-pedantic</B><DD>



Issue all the warnings demanded by strict <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></FONT>;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.</FONT>  For <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C,</FONT> follows the
version of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> standard specified by any <B>-std</B> option used.


<P>


Valid <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></FONT> programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <B>-ansi</B> or a
<B>-std</B> option specifying the required version of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT>).  However,
without this option, certain <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions and traditional C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.


<P>


<B>-Wpedantic</B> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <B>__</B>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<TT>&quot;__extension__&quot;</TT>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.


<P>


Some users try to use <B>-Wpedantic</B> to check programs for strict <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO
C</FONT> conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all---only those for which
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> <I>requires</I> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.


<P>


A feature to report any failure to conform to <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <B>-Wpedantic</B>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.


<P>


Where the standard specified with <B>-std</B> represents a <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
extended dialect of C, such as <B>gnu90</B> or <B>gnu99</B>, there is a
corresponding <I>base standard</I>, the version of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> on which the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <B>-Wpedantic</B> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU
C</FONT> dialect, since by definition the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
<DT id="347"><B>-pedantic-errors</B><DD>


Give an error whenever the <I>base standard</I> (see <B>-Wpedantic</B>)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to <B>-Werror=pedantic</B>, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.
<DT id="348"><B>-Wall</B><DD>


This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <B>C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> Dialect

Note that some warning flags are not implied by <B>-Wall</B>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <B>-Wextra</B> but many of
them must be enabled individually.
<DT id="349"><B>-Wextra</B><DD>


This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
<B>-Wall</B>. (This option used to be called <B>-W</B>.  The older

Warn if an array subscript has type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some

This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="359"><B>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</B><DD>


Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
<B>-fprofile-use</B> option.
If a source file is changed between compiling with <B>-fprofile-generate</B>
and with <B>-fprofile-use</B>, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> cannot use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  <B>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</B> can be used to disable the
warning or <B>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</B> can be used to
disable the error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code and is useful only in the
case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base.
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.

<DT id="361"><B>-Wdouble-promotion</B> (C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Give a warning when a value of type <TT>&quot;float&quot;</TT> is implicitly
promoted to <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>.  CPUs with a 32-bit ``single-precision''
floating-point unit implement <TT>&quot;float&quot;</TT> in hardware, but emulate
<TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.


<P>


It is easy to accidentally do computations with <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>.  For
example, in:


<P>




<PRE>
        float area(float radius)
        {
           return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


the compiler performs the entire computation with <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>
because the floating-point literal is a <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="362"><B>-Wduplicate-decl-specifier</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if a declaration has duplicate <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;volatile&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;restrict&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;_Atomic&quot;</TT> specifier.  This warning is enabled by
<B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="363"><B>-Wformat</B><DD>



<DT id="364"><B>-Wformat=</B><I>n</I><DD>



Check calls to <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes, in the <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;strftime&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;strfmon&quot;</TT> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<B>-ffreestanding</B> or <B>-fno-builtin</B>.


<P>


The formats are checked against the format features supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
libc version 2.2.  These include all <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90</FONT> and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some <FONT SIZE="-1">BSD</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if <B>-Wpedantic</B> is used
with <B>-Wformat</B>, warnings are given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <TT>&quot;strfmon&quot;</TT> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).
<DL COMPACT><DT id="365"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="366"><B>-Wformat=1</B><DD>



<DT id="367"><B>-Wformat</B><DD>



Option <B>-Wformat</B> is equivalent to <B>-Wformat=1</B>, and
<B>-Wno-format</B> is equivalent to <B>-Wformat=0</B>.  Since
<B>-Wformat</B> also checks for null format arguments for several
functions, <B>-Wformat</B> also implies <B>-Wnonnull</B>.  Some
aspects of this level of format checking can be disabled by the
options: <B>-Wno-format-contains-nul</B>,
<B>-Wno-format-extra-args</B>, and <B>-Wno-format-zero-length</B>.
<B>-Wformat</B> is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="368"><B>-Wno-format-contains-nul</B><DD>


If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, do not warn about format strings that
contain <FONT SIZE="-1">NUL</FONT> bytes.
<DT id="369"><B>-Wno-format-extra-args</B><DD>


If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
<TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.


<P>


Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with <B>$</B> operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <TT>&quot;va_arg&quot;</TT> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT> formats, this option suppresses the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.
<DT id="370"><B>-Wformat-overflow</B><DD>



<DT id="371"><B>-Wformat-overflow=</B><I>level</I><DD>



Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as <TT>&quot;sprintf&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;vsprintf&quot;</TT> that might overflow the destination buffer.  When the
exact number of bytes written by a format directive cannot be determined
at compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the
<I>level</I> argument and on optimization.  While enabling optimization
will in most cases improve the accuracy of the warning, it may also
result in false positives.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="372"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="373"><B>-Wformat-overflow</B><DD>



<DT id="374"><B>-Wformat-overflow=1</B><DD>



Level <I>1</I> of <B>-Wformat-overflow</B> enabled by <B>-Wformat</B>
employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
likely overflow the buffer.  At this level, numeric arguments to format
directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known
to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output
is bounded either by their directive's precision or by a finite set of
string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range that
results in the most bytes on output.  For example, the call to <TT>&quot;sprintf&quot;</TT>
below is diagnosed because even with both <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> equal to zero,
the terminating <FONT SIZE="-1">NUL</FONT> character (<TT>'\0'</TT>) appended by the function
to the destination buffer will be written past its end.  Increasing
the size of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the
warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.


<P>




<PRE>
        void f (int a, int b)
        {
          char buf [13];
          sprintf (buf, &quot;a = %i, b = %i\n&quot;, a, b);
        }

</PRE>


<DT id="375"><B>-Wformat-overflow=2</B><DD>


Level <I>2</I> warns also about calls that might overflow the destination
buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.  At level
<I>2</I>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and
the maximum representable value otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose
length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive's precision,
or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the character
array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.


<P>


At level <I>2</I>, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but
this time because with <I>a</I> equal to a 32-bit <TT>&quot;INT_MIN&quot;</TT> the first
<TT>%i</TT> directive will write some of its digits beyond the end of
the destination buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the values
of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased
to at least 34 bytes.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> includes the minimum size of the buffer in
an informational note following the warning.


<P>


An alternative to increasing the size of the destination buffer is to
constrain the range of formatted values.  The maximum length of string
arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision in the format
directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed
to be bounded by less than the precision of their type, choosing
an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce
the required buffer size.  For example, if <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> in the
example above can be assumed to be within the precision of
the <TT>&quot;short int&quot;</TT> type then using either the <TT>%hi</TT> format
directive or casting the argument to <TT>&quot;short&quot;</TT> reduces the maximum
required size of the buffer to 24 bytes.


<P>




<PRE>
        void f (int a, int b)
        {
          char buf [23];
          sprintf (buf, &quot;a = %hi, b = %i\n&quot;, a, (short)b);
        }

<DT id="380"><B>-Wformat-security</B><DD>


If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;scanf&quot;</TT> functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in <TT>&quot;printf (foo);&quot;</TT>.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains <B></B>%n<B></B>.  (This is
currently a subset of what <B>-Wformat-nonliteral</B> warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to <B>-Wformat-security</B> that are not
included in <B>-Wformat-nonliteral</B>.)
<DT id="381"><B>-Wformat-signedness</B><DD>


If <B>-Wformat</B> is specified, also warn if the format string

<DT id="382"><B>-Wformat-truncation</B><DD>



<DT id="383"><B>-Wformat-truncation=</B><I>level</I><DD>



Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as <TT>&quot;snprintf&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;vsnprintf&quot;</TT> that might result in output truncation.  When the exact
number of bytes written by a format directive cannot be determined at
compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on
the <I>level</I> argument and on optimization.  While enabling optimization
will in most cases improve the accuracy of the warning, it may also result
in false positives.  Except as noted otherwise, the option uses the same

Warn if the compiler detects paths that trigger erroneous or

<P>


This warning does not warn when the last statement of a case cannot
fall through, e.g. when there is a return statement or a call to function
declared with the noreturn attribute.  <B>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=</B>
also takes into account control flow statements, such as ifs, and only
warns when appropriate.  E.g.

          case 1:
            if (i &gt; 3) {

</DL>

<DT id="422"><B>-Wif-not-aligned</B> (C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Control if warning triggered by the <TT>&quot;warn_if_not_aligned&quot;</TT> attribute
should be issued.  This is enabled by default.
Use <B>-Wno-if-not-aligned</B> to disable it.
<DT id="423"><B>-Wignored-qualifiers</B> (C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT>.  For <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> such a type qualifier has no effect,
since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue.
For C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, the warning is only emitted for scalar types or <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>.
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> prohibits qualified <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT> return types on function
definitions, so such return types always receive a warning
even without this option.


<P>


This warning is also enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="424"><B>-Wignored-attributes</B> (C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when an attribute is ignored.  This is different from the
<B>-Wattributes</B> option in that it warns whenever the compiler decides
to drop an attribute, not that the attribute is either unknown, used in a
wrong place, etc.  This warning is enabled by default.
<DT id="425"><B>-Wmain</B><DD>


Warn if the type of <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> is suspicious.  <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> should be
a function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.  This warning
is enabled by default in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and is enabled by either <B>-Wall</B>
or <B>-Wpedantic</B>.
<DT id="426"><B>-Wmisleading-indentation</B> (C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when the indentation of the code does not reflect the block structure.
Specifically, a warning is issued for <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;while&quot;</TT>, and
<TT>&quot;for&quot;</TT> clauses with a guarded statement that does not use braces,
followed by an unguarded statement with the same indentation.


<P>


In the following example, the call to ``bar'' is misleadingly indented as
if it were guarded by the ``if'' conditional.


<P>




<PRE>
          if (some_condition ())
            foo ();
            bar ();  /* Gotcha: this is not guarded by the &quot;if&quot;.  */

</PRE>




<P>


In the case of mixed tabs and spaces, the warning uses the
<B>-ftabstop=</B> option to determine if the statements line up
(defaulting to 8).


<P>


The warning is not issued for code involving multiline preprocessor logic
such as the following example.


<P>




<PRE>
          if (flagA)
            foo (0);
        #if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD
          if (flagB)
        #endif
            foo (1);

</PRE>




<P>


The warning is not issued after a <TT>&quot;#line&quot;</TT> directive, since this
typically indicates autogenerated code, and no assumptions can be made
about the layout of the file that the directive references.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B> in C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT id="427"><B>-Wmissing-attributes</B><DD>


Warn when a declaration of a function is missing one or more attributes
that a related function is declared with and whose absence may adversely
affect the correctness or efficiency of generated code.  For example,
the warning is issued for declarations of aliases that use attributes
to specify less restrictive requirements than those of their targets.
This typically represents a potential optimization opportunity.
By contrast, the <B>-Wattribute-alias=2</B> option controls warnings
issued when the alias is more restrictive than the target, which could
lead to incorrect code generation.
Attributes considered include <TT>&quot;alloc_align&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;alloc_size&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;cold&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;hot&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;leaf&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;malloc&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;nonnull&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;nothrow&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;pure&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;returns_nonnull&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;returns_twice&quot;</TT>.


<P>


In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, the warning is issued when an explicit specialization of a primary
template declared with attribute <TT>&quot;alloc_align&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;alloc_size&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;assume_aligned&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;format_arg&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;malloc&quot;</TT>,
or <TT>&quot;nonnull&quot;</TT> is declared without it.  Attributes <TT>&quot;deprecated&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;error&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;warning&quot;</TT> suppress the warning..


<P>


You can use the <TT>&quot;copy&quot;</TT> attribute to apply the same
set of attributes to a declaration as that on another declaration without
explicitly enumerating the attributes. This attribute can be applied
to declarations of functions,
variables, or types.


<P>


<B>-Wmissing-attributes</B> is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.


<P>


For example, since the declaration of the primary function template
below makes use of both attribute <TT>&quot;malloc&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;alloc_size&quot;</TT>
the declaration of the explicit specialization of the template is
diagnosed because it is missing one of the attributes.


<P>




<PRE>
        template &lt;class T&gt;
        T* __attribute__ ((malloc, alloc_size (1)))
        allocate (size_t);
        
        template &lt;&gt;
        void* __attribute__ ((malloc))   // missing alloc_size
        allocate&lt;void&gt; (size_t);

</PRE>


<DT id="428"><B>-Wmissing-braces</B><DD>


Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for <TT>&quot;a&quot;</TT> is not fully
bracketed, but that for <TT>&quot;b&quot;</TT> is fully bracketed.  This warning is
enabled by <B>-Wall</B> in C.


<P>




<PRE>
        int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
        int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="429"><B>-Wmissing-include-dirs</B> (C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.
<DT id="430"><B>-Wmissing-profile</B><DD>


Warn if feedback profiles are missing when using the
<B>-fprofile-use</B> option.
This option diagnoses those cases where a new function or a new file is added
to the user code between compiling with <B>-fprofile-generate</B> and with
<B>-fprofile-use</B>, without regenerating the profiles.  In these cases, the
profile feedback data files do not contain any profile feedback information for
the newly added function or file respectively.  Also, in the case when profile
count data (.gcda) files are removed, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> cannot use any profile feedback
information.  In all these cases, warnings are issued to inform the user that a
profile generation step is due.  <B>-Wno-missing-profile</B> can be used to
disable the warning.  Ignoring the warning can result in poorly optimized code.
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended and should be done only
when non-existent profile data is justified.
<DT id="431"><B>-Wmultistatement-macros</B><DD>


Warn about unsafe multiple statement macros that appear to be guarded
by a clause such as <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;for&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT>, or
<TT>&quot;while&quot;</TT>, in which only the first statement is actually guarded after
the macro is expanded.


<P>


For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        #define DOIT x++; y++
        if (c)
          DOIT;

</PRE>




<P>


will increment <TT>&quot;y&quot;</TT> unconditionally, not just when <TT>&quot;c&quot;</TT> holds.
The can usually be fixed by wrapping the macro in a do-while loop:


<P>




<PRE>
        #define DOIT do { x++; y++; } while (0)
        if (c)
          DOIT;

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B> in C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT id="432"><B>-Wparentheses</B><DD>


Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.


<P>


Also warn if a comparison like <TT>&quot;x&lt;=y&lt;=z&quot;</TT> appears; this is
equivalent to <TT>&quot;(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z&quot;</TT>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.


<P>


Also warn for dangerous uses of the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extension to
<TT>&quot;?:&quot;</TT> with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the <TT>&quot;?&quot;</TT>: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.


<P>


For C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> this also warns for some cases of unnecessary parentheses in
declarations, which can indicate an attempt at a function call instead
of a declaration:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
          // Declares a local variable called mymutex.
          std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; (mymutex);
          // User meant std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock (mymutex);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="433"><B>-Wsequence-point</B><DD>


Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standards.


<P>


The C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
program are evaluated in terms of <I>sequence points</I>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<TT>&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;||&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;? :&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;,&quot;</TT> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.


<P>


It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standards specify that ``Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.''.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.


<P>


Examples of code with undefined behavior are <TT>&quot;a = a++;&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;a[n]
= b[n++]&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;a[i++] = i;&quot;</TT>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.


<P>


The C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in
more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand side of an
assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the above
examples are no longer undefined.  But this warning will still warn
about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C
and earlier revisions of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> readings page, at
&lt;<B><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</A></B>&gt;.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B> for C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT id="434"><B>-Wno-return-local-addr</B><DD>


Do not warn about returning a pointer (or in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, a reference) to a
variable that goes out of scope after the function returns.
<DT id="435"><B>-Wreturn-type</B><DD>


Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that defaults
to <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.  Also warn about any <TT>&quot;return&quot;</TT> statement with no
return value in a function whose return type is not <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>
(falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
without a value).


<P>


For C only, warn about a <TT>&quot;return&quot;</TT> statement with an expression in a
function whose return type is <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>, unless the expression type is
also <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>.  As a <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extension, the latter case is accepted
without a warning unless <B>-Wpedantic</B> is used.  Attempting
to use the return value of a non-<TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT> function other than <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>
that flows off the end by reaching the closing curly brace that terminates
the function is undefined.


<P>


Unlike in C, in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, flowing off the end of a non-<TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT> function other
than <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> results in undefined behavior even when the value of
the function is not used.


<P>


This warning is enabled by default in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and by <B>-Wall</B> otherwise.
<DT id="436"><B>-Wshift-count-negative</B><DD>


Warn if shift count is negative. This warning is enabled by default.
<DT id="437"><B>-Wshift-count-overflow</B><DD>

<B>-Wextra</B> in C99 and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 modes (and newer).
<DT id="439"><B>-Wshift-overflow</B><DD>



<DT id="440"><B>-Wshift-overflow=</B><I>n</I><DD>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="441"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="442"><B>-Wshift-overflow=1</B><DD>


This is the warning level of <B>-Wshift-overflow</B> and is enabled
by default in C99 and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 modes (and newer).  This warning level does
not warn about left-shifting 1 into the sign bit.  (However, in C, such
an overflow is still rejected in contexts where an integer constant expression
is required.)  No warning is emitted in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>2A mode (and newer), as signed left
shifts always wrap.
<DT id="443"><B>-Wshift-overflow=2</B><DD>


This warning level also warns about left-shifting 1 into the sign bit,
unless C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>14 mode (or newer) is active.

<DT id="445"><B>-Wswitch</B><DD>


Warn whenever a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a <TT>&quot;case&quot;</TT> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a <TT>&quot;default&quot;</TT> label prevents this
warning.)  <TT>&quot;case&quot;</TT> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used (even if there is a
<TT>&quot;default&quot;</TT> label).
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="446"><B>-Wswitch-default</B><DD>


Warn whenever a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement does not have a <TT>&quot;default&quot;</TT>
case.
<DT id="447"><B>-Wswitch-enum</B><DD>


Warn whenever a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a <TT>&quot;case&quot;</TT> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  <TT>&quot;case&quot;</TT> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
between <B>-Wswitch</B> and this option is that this option gives a
warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a
<TT>&quot;default&quot;</TT> label.
<DT id="448"><B>-Wswitch-bool</B><DD>


Warn whenever a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement has an index of boolean type
and the case values are outside the range of a boolean type.
It is possible to suppress this warning by casting the controlling
expression to a type other than <TT>&quot;bool&quot;</TT>.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        switch ((int) (a == 4))
          {
          ...
          }

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by default for C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.
<DT id="449"><B>-Wswitch-unreachable</B><DD>


Warn whenever a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement contains statements between the
controlling expression and the first case label, which will never be
executed.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        switch (cond)
          {
           i = 15;
          ...
           case 5:
          ...
          }

</PRE>




<P>


<B>-Wswitch-unreachable</B> does not warn if the statement between the
controlling expression and the first case label is just a declaration:


<P>




<PRE>
        switch (cond)
          {
           int i;
          ...

<DT id="458"><B>-Wunused-variable</B><DD>


Warn whenever a local or static variable is unused aside from its

To suppress this warning use the <TT>&quot;unused&quot;</TT> attribute.
<DT id="459"><B>-Wunused-const-variable</B><DD>



<DT id="460"><B>-Wunused-const-variable=</B><I>n</I><DD>



Warn whenever a constant static variable is unused aside from its declaration.
<B>-Wunused-const-variable=1</B> is enabled by <B>-Wunused-variable</B>
for C, but not for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>. In C this declares variable storage, but in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> this
is not an error since const variables take the place of <TT>&quot;#define&quot;</TT>s.

<DT id="463"><B>-Wunused-const-variable=2</B><DD>


This warning level also warns for unused constant static variables in

<B>-Wunused-const-variable</B> and must be explicitly requested since
in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> this isn't an error and in C it might be harder to clean up all
headers included.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="464"><DD>

<DT id="465"><B>-Wunused-value</B><DD>


Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not
used. To suppress this warning cast the unused expression to
<TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>. This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand
side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example,
an expression such as <TT>&quot;x[i,j]&quot;</TT> causes a warning, while
<TT>&quot;x[(void)i,j]&quot;</TT> does not.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="466"><B>-Wunused</B><DD>


All the above <B>-Wunused</B> options combined.


<P>


In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify <B>-Wextra -Wunused</B> (note that <B>-Wall</B> implies
<B>-Wunused</B>), or separately specify <B>-Wunused-parameter</B>.
<DT id="467"><B>-Wuninitialized</B><DD>


Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a <TT>&quot;setjmp&quot;</TT> call. In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT> member
appears in a class without constructors.


<P>


If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the <B>-Winit-self</B> option.


<P>


These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared <TT>&quot;volatile&quot;</TT>.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> used.


<P>


Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
<DT id="468"><B>-Winvalid-memory-model</B><DD>


Warn for invocations of <B>__atomic Builtins</B>, <B>__sync Builtins</B>,
and the C11 atomic generic functions with a memory consistency argument
that is either invalid for the operation or outside the range of values
of the <TT>&quot;memory_order&quot;</TT> enumeration.  For example, since the
<TT>&quot;__atomic_store&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__atomic_store_n&quot;</TT> built-ins are only
defined for the relaxed, release, and sequentially consistent memory
orders the following code is diagnosed:


<P>




<PRE>
        void store (int *i)
        {
          __atomic_store_n (i, 0, memory_order_consume);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


<B>-Winvalid-memory-model</B> is enabled by default.
<DT id="469"><B>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</B><DD>


For an automatic (i.e. local) variable, if there exists a path from the
function entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time.


<P>


These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not keep track of the state of variables.


<P>


These warnings are made optional because <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may not be able to determine when
the code is correct in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one
example of how this can happen:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
          int x;
          switch (y)
            {
            case 1: x = 1;
              break;
            case 2: x = 4;
              break;
            case 3: x = 5;
            }
          foo (x);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


If the value of <TT>&quot;y&quot;</TT> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <TT>&quot;x&quot;</TT> is
always initialized, but <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> doesn't know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with <B>assert</B>(0) or
similar code.


<P>


This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <TT>&quot;longjmp&quot;</TT>.
The compiler sees only the calls to <TT>&quot;setjmp&quot;</TT>.  It cannot know
where <TT>&quot;longjmp&quot;</TT> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <TT>&quot;longjmp&quot;</TT> cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.


<P>


Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT>.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B> or <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="470"><B>-Wunknown-pragmas</B><DD>


Warn when a <TT>&quot;#pragma&quot;</TT> directive is encountered that is not understood by 
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  If this command-line option is used, warnings are even issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings are only enabled by the <B>-Wall</B> command-line option.
<DT id="471"><B>-Wno-pragmas</B><DD>


Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters,
invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
<B>-Wunknown-pragmas</B>.
<DT id="472"><B>-Wno-prio-ctor-dtor</B><DD>


Do not warn if a priority from 0 to 100 is used for constructor or destructor.
The use of constructor and destructor attributes allow you to assign a
priority to the constructor/destructor to control its order of execution
before <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> is called or after it returns.  The priority values must be
greater than 100 as the compiler reserves priority values between 0--100 for
the implementation.
<DT id="473"><B>-Wstrict-aliasing</B><DD>


This option is only active when <B>-fstrict-aliasing</B> is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in <B>-Wall</B>.
It is equivalent to <B>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</B>
<DT id="474"><B>-Wstrict-aliasing=n</B><DD>


This option is only active when <B>-fstrict-aliasing</B> is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way <B>-O</B> 
works.
<B>-Wstrict-aliasing</B> is equivalent to <B>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</B>.


<P>


Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but <B>-fstrict-aliasing</B> still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.


<P>


Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.


<P>


Level 3 (default for <B>-Wstrict-aliasing</B>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
<TT>&quot;*(int*)&amp;some_float&quot;</TT>.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.
<DT id="475"><B>-Wstrict-overflow</B><DD>



<DT id="476"><B>-Wstrict-overflow=</B><I>n</I><DD>



This option is only active when signed overflow is undefined.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.


<P>


An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="477"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="478"><B>-Wstrict-overflow=1</B><DD>


Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example the compiler simplifies
<TT>&quot;x + 1 &gt; x&quot;</TT> to <TT>1</TT>.  This level of
<B>-Wstrict-overflow</B> is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.
<DT id="479"><B>-Wstrict-overflow=2</B><DD>


Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: <TT>&quot;abs (x) &gt;= 0&quot;</TT>.  This can only be
simplified when signed integer overflow is undefined, because
<TT>&quot;abs (INT_MIN)&quot;</TT> overflows to <TT>&quot;INT_MIN&quot;</TT>, which is less than
zero.  <B>-Wstrict-overflow</B> (with no level) is the same as
<B>-Wstrict-overflow=2</B>.
<DT id="480"><B>-Wstrict-overflow=3</B><DD>


Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: <TT>&quot;x + 1 &gt; 1&quot;</TT> is simplified to <TT>&quot;x &gt; 0&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="481"><B>-Wstrict-overflow=4</B><DD>


Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: <TT>&quot;(x * 10) / 5&quot;</TT> is simplified to <TT>&quot;x * 2&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="482"><B>-Wstrict-overflow=5</B><DD>


Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: <TT>&quot;x + 2 &gt; y&quot;</TT> is
simplified to <TT>&quot;x + 1 &gt;= y&quot;</TT>.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

<DT id="484"><B>-Wstringop-overflow</B><DD>



<DT id="485"><B>-Wstringop-overflow=</B><I>type</I><DD>



Warn for calls to string manipulation functions such as <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;strcpy&quot;</TT> that are determined to overflow the destination buffer.  The
optional argument is one greater than the type of Object Size Checking to
perform to determine the size of the destination.  
The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays
but not for raw memory functions like <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> which always make use
of Object Size type-0.  The option also warns for calls that specify a size
in excess of the largest possible object or at most <TT>&quot;SIZE_MAX / 2&quot;</TT> bytes.
The option produces the best results with optimization enabled but can detect
a small subset of simple buffer overflows even without optimization in
calls to the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> built-in functions like <TT>&quot;__builtin_memcpy&quot;</TT> that
correspond to the standard functions.  In any case, the option warns about
just a subset of buffer overflows detected by the corresponding overflow
checking built-ins.  For example, the option will issue a warning for
the <TT>&quot;strcpy&quot;</TT> call below because it copies at least 5 characters
(the string <TT>&quot;blue&quot;</TT> including the terminating <FONT SIZE="-1">NUL</FONT>) into the buffer
of size 4.

<DL COMPACT><DT id="486"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="487"><B>-Wstringop-overflow</B><DD>



<DT id="488"><B>-Wstringop-overflow=1</B><DD>



The <B>-Wstringop-overflow=1</B> option uses type-zero Object Size Checking
to determine the sizes of destination objects.  This is the default setting
of the option.  At this setting the option will not warn for writes past
the end of subobjects of larger objects accessed by pointers unless the
size of the largest surrounding object is known.  When the destination may
be one of several objects it is assumed to be the largest one of them.  On
Linux systems, when optimization is enabled at this setting the option warns
for the same code as when the <TT>&quot;_FORTIFY_SOURCE&quot;</TT> macro is defined to
a non-zero value.
<DT id="489"><B>-Wstringop-overflow=2</B><DD>


The <B>-Wstringop-overflow=2</B> option uses type-one Object Size Checking
to determine the sizes of destination objects.  At this setting the option
will warn about overflows when writing to members of the largest complete
objects whose exact size is known.  It will, however, not warn for excessive
writes to the same members of unknown objects referenced by pointers since
they may point to arrays containing unknown numbers of elements.
<DT id="490"><B>-Wstringop-overflow=3</B><DD>


The <B>-Wstringop-overflow=3</B> option uses type-two Object Size Checking
to determine the sizes of destination objects.  At this setting the option
warns about overflowing the smallest object or data member.  This is the
most restrictive setting of the option that may result in warnings for safe
code.
<DT id="491"><B>-Wstringop-overflow=4</B><DD>


The <B>-Wstringop-overflow=4</B> option uses type-three Object Size Checking
to determine the sizes of destination objects.  At this setting the option
will warn about overflowing any data members, and when the destination is
one of several objects it uses the size of the largest of them to decide
whether to issue a warning.  Similarly to <B>-Wstringop-overflow=3</B> this
setting of the option may result in warnings for benign code.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="492"><DD>

<DT id="493"><B>-Wstringop-truncation</B><DD>


Warn for calls to bounded string manipulation functions such as <TT>&quot;strncat&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;strncpy&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;stpncpy&quot;</TT> that may either truncate the copied string
or leave the destination unchanged.


<P>


In the following example, the call to <TT>&quot;strncat&quot;</TT> specifies a bound that
is less than the length of the source string.  As a result, the copy of
the source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed.  To avoid the
warning use <TT>&quot;bufsize - strlen (buf) - 1)&quot;</TT> as the bound.


<P>




<PRE>
        void append (char *buf, size_t bufsize)
        {
          strncat (buf, &quot;.txt&quot;, 3);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


As another example, the following call to <TT>&quot;strncpy&quot;</TT> results in copying
to <TT>&quot;d&quot;</TT> just the characters preceding the terminating <FONT SIZE="-1">NUL,</FONT> without
appending the <FONT SIZE="-1">NUL</FONT> to the end.  Assuming the result of <TT>&quot;strncpy&quot;</TT> is
necessarily a NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call
is diagnosed.  To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be
NUL-terminated, call <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> instead.


<P>




<PRE>
        void copy (char *d, const char *s)
        {
          strncpy (d, s, strlen (s));
        }

</PRE>




<P>


In the following example, the call to <TT>&quot;strncpy&quot;</TT> specifies the size
of the destination buffer as the bound.  If the length of the source
string is equal to or greater than this size the result of the copy will
not be NUL-terminated.  Therefore, the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid
the warning, specify <TT>&quot;sizeof buf - 1&quot;</TT> as the bound and set the last
element of the buffer to <TT>&quot;NUL&quot;</TT>.


<P>




<PRE>
        void copy (const char *s)
        {
          char buf[80];
          strncpy (buf, s, sizeof buf);
          ...
        }

</PRE>




<P>


In situations where a character array is intended to store a sequence
of bytes with no terminating <TT>&quot;NUL&quot;</TT> such an array may be annotated
with attribute <TT>&quot;nonstring&quot;</TT> to avoid this warning.  Such arrays,
however, are not suitable arguments to functions that expect
<TT>&quot;NUL&quot;</TT>-terminated strings.  To help detect accidental misuses of
such arrays <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> issues warnings unless it can prove that the use is
safe.

<DT id="499"><B>-Wmissing-noreturn</B><DD>


<DT id="500"><B>-Wsuggest-attribute=malloc</B><DD>



Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes
<TT>&quot;pure&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;malloc&quot;</TT>. The compiler
only warns for functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case of
<TT>&quot;pure&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT>) if it cannot prove that the function returns
normally. A function returns normally if it doesn't contain an infinite loop or
return abnormally by throwing, calling <TT>&quot;abort&quot;</TT> or trapping.  This analysis
requires option <B>-fipa-pure-const</B>, which is enabled by default at
<B>-O</B> and higher.  Higher optimization levels improve the accuracy
of the analysis.
<DT id="501"><B>-Wsuggest-attribute=format</B><DD>



<DT id="502"><B>-Wmissing-format-attribute</B><DD>



Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT>
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> guesses that function pointers with <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT>
attribute to avoid the warning.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> also warns about function definitions that might be
candidates for <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> guesses that <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
<TT>&quot;vprintf&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;vscanf&quot;</TT>, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which <TT>&quot;format&quot;</TT> attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.
<DT id="503"><B>-Wsuggest-attribute=cold</B><DD>


Warn about functions that might be candidates for <TT>&quot;cold&quot;</TT> attribute.  This
is based on static detection and generally will only warn about functions which
always leads to a call to another <TT>&quot;cold&quot;</TT> function such as wrappers of
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <TT>&quot;throw&quot;</TT> or fatal error reporting functions leading to <TT>&quot;abort&quot;</TT>.

<DT id="505"><B>-Wsuggest-final-types</B><DD>


Warn about types with virtual methods where code quality would be improved
if the type were declared with the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 <TT>&quot;final&quot;</TT> specifier, 
or, if possible,
declared in an anonymous namespace. This allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to more aggressively
devirtualize the polymorphic calls. This warning is more effective with link
time optimization, where the information about the class hierarchy graph is
more complete.
<DT id="506"><B>-Wsuggest-final-methods</B><DD>


Warn about virtual methods where code quality would be improved if the method
were declared with the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 <TT>&quot;final&quot;</TT> specifier, 
or, if possible, its type were
declared in an anonymous namespace or with the <TT>&quot;final&quot;</TT> specifier.
This warning is
more effective with link-time optimization, where the information about the
class hierarchy graph is more complete. It is recommended to first consider
suggestions of <B>-Wsuggest-final-types</B> and then rebuild with new
annotations.
<DT id="507"><B>-Wsuggest-override</B><DD>


Warn about overriding virtual functions that are not marked with the override
keyword.
<DT id="508"><B>-Walloc-zero</B><DD>


Warn about calls to allocation functions decorated with attribute
<TT>&quot;alloc_size&quot;</TT> that specify zero bytes, including those to the built-in
forms of the functions <TT>&quot;aligned_alloc&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;calloc&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;malloc&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;realloc&quot;</TT>.  Because the behavior of these functions
when called with a zero size differs among implementations (and in the case
of <TT>&quot;realloc&quot;</TT> has been deprecated) relying on it may result in subtle
portability bugs and should be avoided.
<DT id="509"><B>-Walloc-size-larger-than=</B><I>byte-size</I><DD>


Warn about calls to functions decorated with attribute <TT>&quot;alloc_size&quot;</TT>
that attempt to allocate objects larger than the specified number of bytes,
or where the result of the size computation in an integer type with infinite
precision would exceed the value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PTRDIFF_MAX</B></FONT><B></B> on the target.
<B>-Walloc-size-larger-than=</B><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PTRDIFF_MAX</B></FONT><B></B> is enabled by default.
Warnings controlled by the option can be disabled either by specifying
<I>byte-size</I> of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIZE_MAX</B></FONT><B></B> or more or by
<B>-Wno-alloc-size-larger-than</B>.
<DT id="510"><B>-Wno-alloc-size-larger-than</B><DD>


Disable <B>-Walloc-size-larger-than=</B> warnings.  The option is
equivalent to <B>-Walloc-size-larger-than=</B><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIZE_MAX</B></FONT><B></B> or
larger.
<DT id="511"><B>-Walloca</B><DD>


This option warns on all uses of <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> in the source.
<DT id="512"><B>-Walloca-larger-than=</B><I>byte-size</I><DD>


This option warns on calls to <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> with an integer argument whose
value is either zero, or that is not bounded by a controlling predicate
that limits its value to at most <I>byte-size</I>.  It also warns for calls
to <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> where the bound value is unknown.  Arguments of non-integer
types are considered unbounded even if they appear to be constrained to
the expected range.


<P>


For example, a bounded case of <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> could be:


<P>




<PRE>
        void func (size_t n)
        {
          void *p;
          if (n &lt;= 1000)
            p = alloca (n);
          else
            p = malloc (n);
          f (p);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


In the above example, passing <TT>&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=1000&quot;</TT> would not
issue a warning because the call to <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> is known to be at most
1000 bytes.  However, if <TT>&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=500&quot;</TT> were passed,
the compiler would emit a warning.


<P>


Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> with no
controlling predicate constraining its integer argument.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        void func ()
        {
          void *p = alloca (n);
          f (p);
        }

</PRE>




<P>


If <TT>&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=500&quot;</TT> were passed, the above would trigger
a warning, but this time because of the lack of bounds checking.


<P>


Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could
cause a warning:


<P>




<PRE>
        void func (signed int n)

<P>


In the above example, <I>n</I> could be negative, causing a larger than

<DT id="514"><B>-Warray-bounds</B><DD>



<DT id="515"><B>-Warray-bounds=</B><I>n</I><DD>



This option is only active when <B>-ftree-vrp</B> is active

<DT id="518"><B>-Warray-bounds=2</B><DD>

<DT id="520"><B>-Wattribute-alias=</B><I>n</I><DD>



<DT id="521"><B>-Wno-attribute-alias</B><DD>



Warn about declarations using the <TT>&quot;alias&quot;</TT> and similar attributes whose
target is incompatible with the type of the alias.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="522"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="523"><B>-Wattribute-alias=1</B><DD>


The default warning level of the <B>-Wattribute-alias</B> option diagnoses
incompatibilities between the type of the alias declaration and that of its
target.  Such incompatibilities are typically indicative of bugs.
<DT id="524"><B>-Wattribute-alias=2</B><DD>


At this level <B>-Wattribute-alias</B> also diagnoses cases where
the attributes of the alias declaration are more restrictive than the
attributes applied to its target.  These mismatches can potentially
result in incorrect code generation.  In other cases they may be
benign and could be resolved simply by adding the missing attribute to
the target.  For comparison, see the <B>-Wmissing-attributes</B>
option, which controls diagnostics when the alias declaration is less
restrictive than the target, rather than more restrictive.


<P>


Attributes considered include <TT>&quot;alloc_align&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;alloc_size&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;cold&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;hot&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;leaf&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;malloc&quot;</TT>,

</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="525"><DD>


<P>


<B>-Wattribute-alias</B> is equivalent to <B>-Wattribute-alias=1</B>.
This is the default.  You can disable these warnings with either
<B>-Wno-attribute-alias</B> or <B>-Wattribute-alias=0</B>.
</DL>

<DT id="526"><B>-Wbool-compare</B><DD>


Warn about boolean expression compared with an integer value different from
<TT>&quot;true&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;false&quot;</TT>.  For instance, the following comparison is
always false:


<P>




<PRE>
        int n = 5;
        ...
        if ((n &gt; 1) == 2) { ... }

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="527"><B>-Wbool-operation</B><DD>


Warn about suspicious operations on expressions of a boolean type.  For
instance, bitwise negation of a boolean is very likely a bug in the program.
For C, this warning also warns about incrementing or decrementing a boolean,
which rarely makes sense.  (In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, decrementing a boolean is always invalid.
Incrementing a boolean is invalid in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>17, and deprecated otherwise.)


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="528"><B>-Wduplicated-branches</B><DD>


Warn when an if-else has identical branches.  This warning detects cases like


<P>




<PRE>
        if (p != NULL)
          return 0;
        else
          return 0;

</PRE>




<P>


It doesn't warn when both branches contain just a null statement.  This warning
also warn for conditional operators:


<P>




<PRE>
          int i = x ? *p : *p;

</PRE>


<DT id="529"><B>-Wduplicated-cond</B><DD>


Warn about duplicated conditions in an if-else-if chain.  For instance,
warn for the following code:


<P>




<PRE>
        if (p-&gt;q != NULL) { ... }
        else if (p-&gt;q != NULL) { ... }

</PRE>


<DT id="530"><B>-Wframe-address</B><DD>


Warn when the <B>__builtin_frame_address</B> or <B>__builtin_return_address</B>
is called with an argument greater than 0.  Such calls may return indeterminate
values or crash the program.  The warning is included in <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="531"><B>-Wno-discarded-qualifiers</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Do not warn if type qualifiers on pointers are being discarded.
Typically, the compiler warns if a <TT>&quot;const char *&quot;</TT> variable is
passed to a function that takes a <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT> parameter.  This option
can be used to suppress such a warning.
<DT id="532"><B>-Wno-discarded-array-qualifiers</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Do not warn if type qualifiers on arrays which are pointer targets
are being discarded. Typically, the compiler warns if a
<TT>&quot;const int (*)[]&quot;</TT> variable is passed to a function that
takes a <TT>&quot;int (*)[]&quot;</TT> parameter.  This option can be used to
suppress such a warning.
<DT id="533"><B>-Wno-incompatible-pointer-types</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Do not warn when there is a conversion between pointers that have incompatible
types.  This warning is for cases not covered by <B>-Wno-pointer-sign</B>,
which warns for pointer argument passing or assignment with different
signedness.
<DT id="534"><B>-Wno-int-conversion</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Do not warn about incompatible integer to pointer and pointer to integer
conversions.  This warning is about implicit conversions; for explicit
conversions the warnings <B>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast</B> and
<B>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast</B> may be used.
<DT id="535"><B>-Wno-div-by-zero</B><DD>


Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating-point
division by zero is not warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of
obtaining infinities and NaNs.
<DT id="536"><B>-Wsystem-headers</B><DD>


Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command-line option tells
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using <B>-Wall</B> in conjunction with this
option does <I>not</I> warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers---for that, <B>-Wunknown-pragmas</B> must also be used.
<DT id="537"><B>-Wtautological-compare</B><DD>


Warn if a self-comparison always evaluates to true or false.  This
warning detects various mistakes such as:


<P>




<PRE>
        int i = 1;
        ...
        if (i &gt; i) { ... }

</PRE>




<P>


This warning also warns about bitwise comparisons that always evaluate
to true or false, for instance:


<P>




<PRE>
        if ((a &amp; 16) == 10) { ... }

</PRE>




<P>


will always be false.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="538"><B>-Wtrampolines</B><DD>


Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.
A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is
used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is
made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But, for
most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack to be
made executable in order for the program to work properly.
<DT id="539"><B>-Wfloat-equal</B><DD>


Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.


<P>


The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.
<DT id="540"><B>-Wtraditional</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C.</FONT>  Also warn about <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="541"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="542">*<DD>
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> it does not.
<DT id="543">*<DD>
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the <B>#</B> appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<B>-Wtraditional</B> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the <B>#</B> does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<TT>&quot;#pragma&quot;</TT> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <TT>&quot;#elif&quot;</TT>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.
<DT id="544">*<DD>
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
<DT id="545">*<DD>
The unary plus operator.
<DT id="546">*<DD>
The <B>U</B> integer constant suffix, or the <B>F</B> or <B>L</B> floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the <B>L</B> suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the <B>_MIN</B>/<B>_MAX</B> macros in <TT>&quot;&lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/limits.h">limits.h</A>&gt;&quot;</TT>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.
<DT id="547">*<DD>
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
<DT id="548">*<DD>
A <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement has an operand of type <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="549">*<DD>
A non-<TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> function declaration follows a <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
<DT id="550">*<DD>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
<DT id="551">*<DD>
Usage of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> string concatenation is detected.
<DT id="552">*<DD>
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
<DT id="553">*<DD>
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
<DT id="554">*<DD>
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <TT>&quot;__STDC__&quot;</TT> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
<DT id="555">*<DD>
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <B>-Wtraditional-conversion</B>.
<DT id="556">*<DD>
Use of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<I>not</I> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> features appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <TT>&quot;PARAMS&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;VPARAMS&quot;</TT>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="557"><DD>
</DL>

<DT id="558"><B>-Wtraditional-conversion</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
<DT id="559"><B>-Wdeclaration-after-statement</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, was introduced with <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99</FONT> and is by default
allowed in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  It is not supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90.</FONT>
<DT id="560"><B>-Wshadow</B><DD>


Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another
variable, parameter, type, class member (in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>), or instance variable
(in Objective-C) or whenever a built-in function is shadowed. Note
that in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, the compiler warns if a local variable shadows an
explicit typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum.
Same as <B>-Wshadow=global</B>.
<DT id="561"><B>-Wno-shadow-ivar</B> (Objective-C only)<DD>


Do not warn whenever a local variable shadows an instance variable in an
Objective-C method.
<DT id="562"><B>-Wshadow=global</B><DD>


The default for <B>-Wshadow</B>. Warns for any (global) shadowing.
<DT id="563"><B>-Wshadow=local</B><DD>


Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wshadow=global</B>.
<DT id="564"><B>-Wshadow=compatible-local</B><DD>


Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter
whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing variable. In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>,
type compatibility here means the type of the shadowing variable can be
converted to that of the shadowed variable. The creation of this flag
(in addition to <B>-Wshadow=local</B>) is based on the idea that when
a local variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most
likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:


<P>




<PRE>
        for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
        {
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
          {
            ...
          }
          ...
        }

</PRE>




<P>


Since the two variable <TT>&quot;i&quot;</TT> in the example above have incompatible types,
enabling only <B>-Wshadow=compatible-local</B> will not emit a warning.
Because their types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one
in place of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an error or
warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in this case will not lead to
undetected bugs. Use of this flag instead of <B>-Wshadow=local</B> can
possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.


<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wshadow=local</B>.
<DT id="565"><B>-Wlarger-than=</B><I>byte-size</I><DD>


Warn whenever an object is defined whose size exceeds <I>byte-size</I>.
<B>-Wlarger-than=</B><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PTRDIFF_MAX</B></FONT><B></B> is enabled by default.
Warnings controlled by the option can be disabled either by specifying

<DT id="567"><B>-Wframe-larger-than=</B><I>byte-size</I><DD>


Warn if the size of a function frame exceeds <I>byte-size</I>.
The computation done to determine the stack frame size is approximate
and not conservative.
The actual requirements may be somewhat greater than <I>byte-size</I>
even if you do not get a warning.  In addition, any space allocated

whether or not to issue a warning.
<B>-Wframe-larger-than=</B><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PTRDIFF_MAX</B></FONT><B></B> is enabled by default.

<DT id="570"><B>-Wstack-usage=</B><I>byte-size</I><DD>


Warn if the stack usage of a function might exceed <I>byte-size</I>.
The computation done to determine the stack usage is conservative.
Any space allocated via <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT>, variable-length arrays, or related

<DT id="577"><B>-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations</B><DD>


Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler cannot
assume anything on the bounds of the loop indices.  With
<B>-funsafe-loop-optimizations</B> warn if the compiler makes
such assumptions.
<DT id="578"><B>-Wno-pedantic-ms-format</B> (MinGW targets only)<DD>


When used in combination with <B>-Wformat</B>

<DT id="579"><B>-Waligned-new</B><DD>


Warn about a new-expression of a type that requires greater alignment
than the <TT>&quot;alignof(std::max_align_t)&quot;</TT> but uses an allocation
function without an explicit alignment parameter. This option is
enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.


<P>


Normally this only warns about global allocation functions, but
<B>-Waligned-new=all</B> also warns about class member allocation
functions.
<DT id="580"><B>-Wplacement-new</B><DD>



<DT id="581"><B>-Wplacement-new=</B><I>n</I><DD>



Warn about placement new expressions with undefined behavior, such as
constructing an object in a buffer that is smaller than the type of
the object.  For example, the placement new expression below is diagnosed
because it attempts to construct an array of 64 integers in a buffer only
64 bytes large.

<DL COMPACT><DT id="582"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="583"><B>-Wplacement-new=1</B><DD>


This is the default warning level of <B>-Wplacement-new</B>.  At this
level the warning is not issued for some strictly undefined constructs that
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> allows as extensions for compatibility with legacy code.  For example,
the following <TT>&quot;new&quot;</TT> expression is not diagnosed at this level even
though it has undefined behavior according to the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard because
it writes past the end of the one-element array.


<P>




<PRE>
        struct S { int n, a[1]; };
        S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 31 * sizeof s-&gt;a[0]);

</PRE>


<DT id="584"><B>-Wplacement-new=2</B><DD>


At this level, in addition to diagnosing all the same constructs as at level
1, a diagnostic is also issued for placement new expressions that construct
an object in the last member of structure whose type is an array of a single
element and whose size is less than the size of the object being constructed.
While the previous example would be diagnosed, the following construct makes
use of the flexible member array extension to avoid the warning at level 2.

<DT id="586"><B>-Wpointer-arith</B><DD>


Warn about anything that depends on the ``size of'' a function type or
of <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU C</FONT> assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with <TT>&quot;void *&quot;</TT> pointers and pointers

<TT>&quot;NULL&quot;</TT>.  This warning is also enabled by <B>-Wpedantic</B>.
<DT id="587"><B>-Wpointer-compare</B><DD>


Warn if a pointer is compared with a zero character constant.  This usually
means that the pointer was meant to be dereferenced.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        const char *p = foo ();
        if (p == '\0')
          return 42;

<DT id="588"><B>-Wtype-limits</B><DD>


Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to the limited

<DT id="589"><B>-Wabsolute-value</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn for calls to standard functions that compute the absolute value

For example, calling <TT>&quot;abs(3.14)&quot;</TT> triggers the warning because the
appropriate function to call to compute the absolute value of a double
argument is <TT>&quot;fabs&quot;</TT>.  The option also triggers warnings when the
argument in a call to such a function has an unsigned type.  This
warning can be suppressed with an explicit type cast and it is also
enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="590"><B>-Wcomment</B><DD>



<DT id="591"><B>-Wcomments</B><DD>



Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <B>/*</B> appears in a <B>/*</B>
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a <B>//</B> comment.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="592"><B>-Wtrigraphs</B><DD>


Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of
the program.  Trigraphs within comments are not warned about,
except those that would form escaped newlines.


<P>


This option is implied by <B>-Wall</B>.  If <B>-Wall</B> is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
<B>-Wall</B> warnings, use <B>-trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs</B>.
<DT id="593"><B>-Wundef</B><DD>


Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an <TT>&quot;#if&quot;</TT> directive.
Such identifiers are replaced with zero.
<DT id="594"><B>-Wexpansion-to-defined</B><DD>


Warn whenever <B>defined</B> is encountered in the expansion of a macro
(including the case where the macro is expanded by an <B>#if</B> directive).
Such usage is not portable.
This warning is also enabled by <B>-Wpedantic</B> and <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="595"><B>-Wunused-macros</B><DD>


Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is <I>used</I> if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor also warns if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.


<P>


Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then the preprocessor reports it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:


<P>




<PRE>
        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
        #endif

</PRE>


<DT id="596"><B>-Wno-endif-labels</B><DD>


Do not warn whenever an <TT>&quot;#else&quot;</TT> or an <TT>&quot;#endif&quot;</TT> are followed by text.
This sometimes happens in older programs with code of the form


<P>




<PRE>
        #if FOO
        ...
        #else FOO
        ...
        #endif FOO

</PRE>




<P>


The second and third <TT>&quot;FOO&quot;</TT> should be in comments.
This warning is on by default.
<DT id="597"><B>-Wbad-function-cast</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn when a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
For example, warn if a call to a function returning an integer type 
is cast to a pointer type.
<DT id="598"><B>-Wc90-c99-compat</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn about features not present in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90,</FONT> but present in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99.</FONT>
For instance, warn about use of variable length arrays, <TT>&quot;long long&quot;</TT>
type, <TT>&quot;bool&quot;</TT> type, compound literals, designated initializers, and so
on.  This option is independent of the standards mode.  Warnings are disabled
in the expression that follows <TT>&quot;__extension__&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="599"><B>-Wc99-c11-compat</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn about features not present in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99,</FONT> but present in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C11.</FONT>
For instance, warn about use of anonymous structures and unions,
<TT>&quot;_Atomic&quot;</TT> type qualifier, <TT>&quot;_Thread_local&quot;</TT> storage-class specifier,
<TT>&quot;_Alignas&quot;</TT> specifier, <TT>&quot;Alignof&quot;</TT> operator, <TT>&quot;_Generic&quot;</TT> keyword,
and so on.  This option is independent of the standards mode.  Warnings are
disabled in the expression that follows <TT>&quot;__extension__&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="600"><B>-Wc11-c2x-compat</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn about features not present in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C11,</FONT> but present in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C2X.</FONT>
For instance, warn about omitting the string in <TT>&quot;_Static_assert&quot;</TT>.
This option is independent of the standards mode.  Warnings are
disabled in the expression that follows <TT>&quot;__extension__&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="601"><B>-Wc++-compat</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn about <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> constructs that are outside of the common subset of
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>,</FONT> e.g. request for implicit conversion from
<TT>&quot;void *&quot;</TT> to a pointer to non-<TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT> type.
<DT id="602"><B>-Wc++11-compat</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn about C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> constructs whose meaning differs between <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> 1998</FONT>
and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> 2011,</FONT> e.g., identifiers in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> 1998</FONT> that are keywords
in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> 2011.</FONT>  This warning turns on <B>-Wnarrowing</B> and is
enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="603"><B>-Wc++14-compat</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn about C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> constructs whose meaning differs between <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> 2011</FONT>
and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> 2014.</FONT>  This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="604"><B>-Wc++17-compat</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn about C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> constructs whose meaning differs between <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> 2014</FONT>
and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> 2017.</FONT>  This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="605"><B>-Wcast-qual</B><DD>


Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
the target type.  For example, warn if a <TT>&quot;const char *&quot;</TT> is cast
to an ordinary <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in an
unsafe way.  For example, casting <TT>&quot;char **&quot;</TT> to <TT>&quot;const char **&quot;</TT>
is unsafe, as in this example:


<P>




<PRE>
          /* p is char ** value.  */
          const char **q = (const char **) p;
          /* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */
          *q = &quot;string&quot;;
          /* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory.  */
          **p = 'b';

</PRE>


<DT id="606"><B>-Wcast-align</B><DD>


Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT> is cast to
an <TT>&quot;int *&quot;</TT> on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two- or four-byte boundaries.
<DT id="607"><B>-Wcast-align=strict</B><DD>


Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT> is cast to
an <TT>&quot;int *&quot;</TT> regardless of the target machine.
<DT id="608"><B>-Wcast-function-type</B><DD>


Warn when a function pointer is cast to an incompatible function pointer.
In a cast involving function types with a variable argument list only
the types of initial arguments that are provided are considered.
Any parameter of pointer-type matches any other pointer-type.  Any benign
differences in integral types are ignored, like <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> vs. <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>
on <FONT SIZE="-1">ILP32</FONT> targets.  Likewise type qualifiers are ignored.  The function
type <TT>&quot;void (*) (void)&quot;</TT> is special and matches everything, which can
be used to suppress this warning.
In a cast involving pointer to member types this warning warns whenever
the type cast is changing the pointer to member type.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="609"><B>-Wwrite-strings</B><DD>


When compiling C, give string constants the type <TT>&quot;const
char[</TT>length<TT>]&quot;</TT> so that copying the address of one into a
non-<TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT> <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT> pointer produces a warning.  These
warnings help you find at compile time code that can try to write
into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful about
using <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT> in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it is
just a nuisance. This is why we did not make <B>-Wall</B> request
these warnings.


<P>


When compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, warn about the deprecated conversion from string
literals to <TT>&quot;char *&quot;</TT>.  This warning is enabled by default for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
programs.
<DT id="610"><B>-Wcatch-value</B><DD>



<DT id="611"><B>-Wcatch-value=</B><I>n</I><B> </B>(C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>



Warn about catch handlers that do not catch via reference.
With <B>-Wcatch-value=1</B> (or <B>-Wcatch-value</B> for short)
warn about polymorphic class types that are caught by value.
With <B>-Wcatch-value=2</B> warn about all class types that are caught
by value. With <B>-Wcatch-value=3</B> warn about all types that are
not caught by reference. <B>-Wcatch-value</B> is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="612"><B>-Wclobbered</B><DD>


Warn for variables that might be changed by <TT>&quot;longjmp&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;vfork&quot;</TT>.  This warning is also enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="613"><B>-Wconditionally-supported</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn for conditionally-supported (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 [intro.defs]) constructs.
<DT id="614"><B>-Wconversion</B><DD>


Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This includes
conversions between real and integer, like <TT>&quot;abs (x)&quot;</TT> when
<TT>&quot;x&quot;</TT> is <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>; conversions between signed and unsigned,
like <TT>&quot;unsigned ui = -1&quot;</TT>; and conversions to smaller types, like
<TT>&quot;sqrtf (M_PI)&quot;</TT>. Do not warn for explicit casts like <TT>&quot;abs
((int) x)&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;ui = (unsigned) -1&quot;</TT>, or if the value is not
changed by the conversion like in <TT>&quot;abs (2.0)&quot;</TT>.  Warnings about
conversions between signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by
using <B>-Wno-sign-conversion</B>.


<P>


For C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined
conversions; and conversions that never use a type conversion
operator: conversions to <TT>&quot;void&quot;</TT>, the same type, a base class or a
reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed and
unsigned integers are disabled by default in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> unless
<B>-Wsign-conversion</B> is explicitly enabled.
<DT id="615"><B>-Wno-conversion-null</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Do not warn for conversions between <TT>&quot;NULL&quot;</TT> and non-pointer
types. <B>-Wconversion-null</B> is enabled by default.
<DT id="616"><B>-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when a literal <B>0</B> is used as null pointer constant.  This can
be useful to facilitate the conversion to <TT>&quot;nullptr&quot;</TT> in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11.
<DT id="617"><B>-Wsubobject-linkage</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if a class type has a base or a field whose type uses the anonymous
namespace or depends on a type with no linkage.  If a type A depends on
a type B with no or internal linkage, defining it in multiple
translation units would be an <FONT SIZE="-1">ODR</FONT> violation because the meaning of B
is different in each translation unit.  If A only appears in a single
translation unit, the best way to silence the warning is to give it
internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous namespace as well.  The
compiler doesn't give this warning for types defined in the main .C
file, as those are unlikely to have multiple definitions.
<B>-Wsubobject-linkage</B> is enabled by default.
<DT id="618"><B>-Wdangling-else</B><DD>


Warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement an <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
          if (a)
            if (b)
              foo ();
          else
            bar ();
        }

</PRE>




<P>


In C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, every <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> branch belongs to the innermost possible
<TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement, which in this example is <TT>&quot;if (b)&quot;</TT>.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement so there is no way the <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT>
can belong to the enclosing <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>.  The resulting code
looks like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
          if (a)
            {
              if (b)
                foo ();
              else
                bar ();
            }
        }

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wparentheses</B>.
<DT id="619"><B>-Wdate-time</B><DD>


Warn when macros <TT>&quot;__TIME__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__DATE__&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;__TIMESTAMP__&quot;</TT>
are encountered as they might prevent bit-wise-identical reproducible
compilations.
<DT id="620"><B>-Wdelete-incomplete</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when deleting a pointer to incomplete type, which may cause
undefined behavior at runtime.  This warning is enabled by default.
<DT id="621"><B>-Wuseless-cast</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn when an expression is casted to its own type.
<DT id="622"><B>-Wempty-body</B><DD>


Warn if an empty body occurs in an <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;do
while&quot;</TT> statement.  This warning is also enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="623"><B>-Wenum-compare</B><DD>


Warn about a comparison between values of different enumerated types.
In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> enumerated type mismatches in conditional expressions are also
diagnosed and the warning is enabled by default.  In C this warning is 
enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="624"><B>-Wextra-semi</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn about redundant semicolon after in-class function definition.
<DT id="625"><B>-Wjump-misses-init</B> (C, Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if a <TT>&quot;goto&quot;</TT> statement or a <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> statement jumps
forward across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a
label after the variable has been initialized.  This only warns about
variables that are initialized when they are declared.  This warning is
only supported for C and Objective-C; in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> this sort of branch is an
error in any case.


<P>


<B>-Wjump-misses-init</B> is included in <B>-Wc++-compat</B>.  It
can be disabled with the <B>-Wno-jump-misses-init</B> option.
<DT id="626"><B>-Wsign-compare</B><DD>


Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, this warning is also enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.  In C, it is
also enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="627"><B>-Wsign-conversion</B><DD>


Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an integer
value, like assigning a signed integer expression to an unsigned
integer variable. An explicit cast silences the warning. In C, this
option is enabled also by <B>-Wconversion</B>.
<DT id="628"><B>-Wfloat-conversion</B><DD>


Warn for implicit conversions that reduce the precision of a real value.
This includes conversions from real to integer, and from higher precision
real to lower precision real values.  This option is also enabled by
<B>-Wconversion</B>.
<DT id="629"><B>-Wno-scalar-storage-order</B><DD>


Do not warn on suspicious constructs involving reverse scalar storage order.
<DT id="630"><B>-Wsized-deallocation</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn about a definition of an unsized deallocation function


<P>




<PRE>
        void operator delete (void *) noexcept;
        void operator delete[] (void *) noexcept;

</PRE>




<P>


without a definition of the corresponding sized deallocation function


<P>




<PRE>
        void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
        void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;

</PRE>




<P>


or vice versa.  Enabled by <B>-Wextra</B> along with
<B>-fsized-deallocation</B>.
<DT id="631"><B>-Wsizeof-pointer-div</B><DD>


Warn for suspicious divisions of two sizeof expressions that divide
the pointer size by the element size, which is the usual way to compute
the array size but won't work out correctly with pointers.  This warning
warns e.g. about <TT>&quot;sizeof (ptr) / sizeof (ptr[0])&quot;</TT> if <TT>&quot;ptr&quot;</TT> is
not an array, but a pointer.  This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="632"><B>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</B><DD>


Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and memory built-in
functions if the argument uses <TT>&quot;sizeof&quot;</TT>.  This warning triggers for
example for <TT>&quot;memset (ptr, 0, sizeof (ptr));&quot;</TT> if <TT>&quot;ptr&quot;</TT> is not
an array, but a pointer, and suggests a possible fix, or about
<TT>&quot;memcpy (&amp;foo, ptr, sizeof (&amp;foo));&quot;</TT>.  <B>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</B>
also warns about calls to bounded string copy functions like <TT>&quot;strncat&quot;</TT>
or <TT>&quot;strncpy&quot;</TT> that specify as the bound a <TT>&quot;sizeof&quot;</TT> expression of
the source array.  For example, in the following function the call to
<TT>&quot;strncat&quot;</TT> specifies the size of the source string as the bound.  That
is almost certainly a mistake and so the call is diagnosed.


<P>




<PRE>
        void make_file (const char *name)
        {
          char path[PATH_MAX];
          strncpy (path, name, sizeof path - 1);
          strncat (path, &quot;.text&quot;, sizeof &quot;.text&quot;);
          ...
        }

</PRE>




<P>


The <B>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</B> option is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="633"><B>-Wsizeof-array-argument</B><DD>


Warn when the <TT>&quot;sizeof&quot;</TT> operator is applied to a parameter that is
declared as an array in a function definition.  This warning is enabled by
default for C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs.
<DT id="634"><B>-Wmemset-elt-size</B><DD>


Warn for suspicious calls to the <TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT> built-in function, if the
first argument references an array, and the third argument is a number
equal to the number of elements, but not equal to the size of the array
in memory.  This indicates that the user has omitted a multiplication by
the element size.  This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="635"><B>-Wmemset-transposed-args</B><DD>


Warn for suspicious calls to the <TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT> built-in function where
the second argument is not zero and the third argument is zero.  For
example, the call <TT>&quot;memset (buf, sizeof buf, 0)&quot;</TT> is diagnosed because
<TT>&quot;memset (buf, 0, sizeof buf)&quot;</TT> was meant instead.  The diagnostic
is only emitted if the third argument is a literal zero.  Otherwise, if
it is an expression that is folded to zero, or a cast of zero to some
type, it is far less likely that the arguments have been mistakenly
transposed and no warning is emitted.  This warning is enabled
by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="636"><B>-Waddress</B><DD>


Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
<TT>&quot;void func(void); if (func)&quot;</TT>, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as <TT>&quot;if (x == &quot;abc&quot;)&quot;</TT>.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use <TT>&quot;strcmp&quot;</TT>.  This warning is enabled by
<B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="637"><B>-Waddress-of-packed-member</B><DD>


Warn when the address of packed member of struct or union is taken,
which usually results in an unaligned pointer value.  This is
enabled by default.
<DT id="638"><B>-Wlogical-op</B><DD>


Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.
This includes using logical operators in contexts where a
bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.  Also warns when
the operands of a logical operator are the same:


<P>




<PRE>
        extern int a;
        if (a &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; a &lt; 0) { ... }

</PRE>


<DT id="639"><B>-Wlogical-not-parentheses</B><DD>


Warn about logical not used on the left hand side operand of a comparison.
This option does not warn if the right operand is considered to be a boolean
expression.  Its purpose is to detect suspicious code like the following:


<P>




<PRE>
        int a;
        ...
        if (!a &gt; 1) { ... }

</PRE>




<P>


It is possible to suppress the warning by wrapping the <FONT SIZE="-1">LHS</FONT> into
parentheses:


<P>




<PRE>
        if ((!a) &gt; 1) { ... }

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="640"><B>-Waggregate-return</B><DD>


Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)
<DT id="641"><B>-Wno-aggressive-loop-optimizations</B><DD>


Warn if in a loop with constant number of iterations the compiler detects
undefined behavior in some statement during one or more of the iterations.
<DT id="642"><B>-Wno-attributes</B><DD>


Do not warn if an unexpected <TT>&quot;__attribute__&quot;</TT> is used, such as
unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
etc.  This does not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
attributes.
<DT id="643"><B>-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch</B><DD>


Warn if a built-in function is declared with an incompatible signature
or as a non-function, or when a built-in function declared with a type
that does not include a prototype is called with arguments whose promoted
types do not match those expected by the function.  When <B>-Wextra</B>
is specified, also warn when a built-in function that takes arguments is
declared without a prototype.  The <B>-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch</B>
warning is enabled by default.  To avoid the warning include the appropriate
header to bring the prototypes of built-in functions into scope.


<P>


For example, the call to <TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT> below is diagnosed by the warning
because the function expects a value of type <TT>&quot;size_t&quot;</TT> as its argument
but the type of <TT>32</TT> is <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>.  With <B>-Wextra</B>,
the declaration of the function is diagnosed as well.


<P>




<PRE>
        extern void* memset ();
        void f (void *d)
        {
          memset (d, '\0', 32);
        }

</PRE>


<DT id="644"><B>-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined</B><DD>


Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This suppresses
warnings for redefinition of <TT>&quot;__TIMESTAMP__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__TIME__&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;__DATE__&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__FILE__&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;__BASE_FILE__&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="645"><B>-Wstrict-prototypes</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration that specifies the argument
types.)
<DT id="646"><B>-Wold-style-declaration</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a
declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers like
<TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning
is also enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="647"><B>-Wold-style-definition</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.
<DT id="648"><B>-Wmissing-parameter-type</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&amp;R-style
functions:


<P>




<PRE>
        void foo(bar) { }

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is also enabled by <B>-Wextra</B>.
<DT id="649"><B>-Wmissing-prototypes</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions
that do not have a matching prototype declaration in a header file.
This option is not valid for C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> because all function declarations
provide prototypes and a non-matching declaration declares an
overload rather than conflict with an earlier declaration.
Use <B>-Wmissing-declarations</B> to detect missing declarations in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT id="650"><B>-Wmissing-declarations</B><DD>


Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for functions with previous
non-prototype declarations; use <B>-Wmissing-prototypes</B> to detect
missing prototypes.  In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, no warnings are issued for function templates,
or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.
<DT id="651"><B>-Wmissing-field-initializers</B><DD>


Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code causes such a warning, because
<TT>&quot;x.h&quot;</TT> is implicitly zero:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct s { int f, g, h; };
        struct s x = { 3, 4 };

</PRE>




<P>


This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification does not trigger a warning:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct s { int f, g, h; };
        struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };

</PRE>




<P>


In C this option does not warn about the universal zero initializer
<B>{ 0 }</B>:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct s { int f, g, h; };
        struct s x = { 0 };

</PRE>




<P>


Likewise, in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> this option does not warn about the empty { }
initializer, for example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct s { int f, g, h; };
        s x = { };

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is included in <B>-Wextra</B>.  To get other <B>-Wextra</B>
warnings without this one, use <B>-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers</B>.
<DT id="652"><B>-Wno-multichar</B><DD>


Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (<B>'</B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>FOOF</B></FONT><B>'</B>) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
<DT id="653"><B>-Wnormalized=</B>[<B>none</B>|<B>id</B>|<B>nfc</B>|<B>nfkc</B>]<DD>


In <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>,</FONT> two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO 10646</FONT> standard sets out some <I>normalization rules</I> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.


<P>


There are four levels of warning supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  The default is
<B>-Wnormalized=nfc</B>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO 10646 ``C''</FONT> normalized form, <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>NFC</I></FONT><I></I>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">NFC</FONT> is the
recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
<B>-Wnormalized</B>.


<P>


Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></FONT> that, when turned into <FONT SIZE="-1">NFC,</FONT> are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and have all your identifiers in <FONT SIZE="-1">NFC.</FONT>
<B>-Wnormalized=id</B> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.


<P>


You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<B>-Wnormalized=none</B> or <B>-Wno-normalized</B>.  You should
only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
``D''), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.


<P>


Some characters in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO 10646</FONT> have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <TT>&quot;\u207F&quot;</TT>, ``<FONT SIZE="-1">SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N'',</FONT> displays just like a regular <TT>&quot;n&quot;</TT> that has been
placed in a superscript.  <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO 10646</FONT> defines the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>NFKC</I></FONT><I></I>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> warns if your code is not in <FONT SIZE="-1">NFKC</FONT> if you use
<B>-Wnormalized=nfkc</B>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.
<DT id="654"><B>-Wno-attribute-warning</B><DD>


Do not warn about usage of functions
declared with <TT>&quot;warning&quot;</TT> attribute.  By default, this warning is
enabled.  <B>-Wno-attribute-warning</B> can be used to disable the
warning or <B>-Wno-error=attribute-warning</B> can be used to
disable the error when compiled with <B>-Werror</B> flag.
<DT id="655"><B>-Wno-deprecated</B><DD>


Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.
<DT id="656"><B>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</B><DD>


Do not warn about uses of functions,
variables, and types marked as deprecated by using the <TT>&quot;deprecated&quot;</TT>
attribute.
<DT id="657"><B>-Wno-overflow</B><DD>


Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.
<DT id="658"><B>-Wno-odr</B><DD>


Warn about One Definition Rule violations during link-time optimization.
Requires <B>-flto-odr-type-merging</B> to be enabled.  Enabled by default.
<DT id="659"><B>-Wopenmp-simd</B><DD>


Warn if the vectorizer cost model overrides the OpenMP
simd directive set by user.  The <B>-fsimd-cost-model=unlimited</B>
option can be used to relax the cost model.
<DT id="660"><B>-Woverride-init</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers.


<P>


This warning is included in <B>-Wextra</B>.  To get other
<B>-Wextra</B> warnings without this one, use <B>-Wextra
-Wno-override-init</B>.
<DT id="661"><B>-Woverride-init-side-effects</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if an initialized field with side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers.  This warning is enabled by default.
<DT id="662"><B>-Wpacked</B><DD>


Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable <TT>&quot;f.x&quot;</TT> in <TT>&quot;struct bar&quot;</TT>
is misaligned even though <TT>&quot;struct bar&quot;</TT> does not itself
have the packed attribute:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct foo {
          int x;
          char a, b, c, d;
        } __attribute__((packed));
        struct bar {
          char z;
          struct foo f;
        };

</PRE>


<DT id="663"><B>-Wpacked-bitfield-compat</B><DD>


The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> ignore the <TT>&quot;packed&quot;</TT> attribute
on bit-fields of type <TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT>.  This has been fixed in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 4.4</FONT> but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 4.4.</FONT>
For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field <TT>&quot;a&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;b&quot;</TT> in this structure:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct foo
        {
          char a:4;
          char b:8;
        } __attribute__ ((packed));

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by default.  Use
<B>-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat</B> to disable this warning.
<DT id="664"><B>-Wpacked-not-aligned</B> (C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, Objective-C and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Warn if a structure field with explicitly specified alignment in a
packed struct or union is misaligned.  For example, a warning will
be issued on <TT>&quot;struct S&quot;</TT>, like, <TT>&quot;warning: alignment 1 of
'struct S' is less than 8&quot;</TT>, in this code:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct __attribute__ ((aligned (8))) S8 { char a[8]; };
        struct __attribute__ ((packed)) S {
          struct S8 s8;
        };

</PRE>




<P>


This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="665"><B>-Wpadded</B><DD>


Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
<DT id="666"><B>-Wredundant-decls</B><DD>


Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
<DT id="667"><B>-Wno-restrict</B><DD>


Warn when an object referenced by a <TT>&quot;restrict&quot;</TT>-qualified parameter
(or, in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, a <TT>&quot;__restrict&quot;</TT>-qualified parameter) is aliased by another
argument, or when copies between such objects overlap.  For example,
the call to the <TT>&quot;strcpy&quot;</TT> function below attempts to truncate the string
by replacing its initial characters with the last four.  However, because
the call writes the terminating <FONT SIZE="-1">NUL</FONT> into <TT>&quot;a[4]&quot;</TT>, the copies overlap and
the call is diagnosed.


<P>




<PRE>
        void foo (void)
        {
          char a[] = &quot;abcd1234&quot;;
          strcpy (a, a + 4);
          ...
        }

</PRE>




<P>


The <B>-Wrestrict</B> option detects some instances of simple overlap
even without optimization but works best at <B>-O2</B> and above.  It
is included in <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="668"><B>-Wnested-externs</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn if an <TT>&quot;extern&quot;</TT> declaration is encountered within a function.
<DT id="669"><B>-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor</B><DD>


Suppress warnings about use of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 inheriting constructors when the
base class inherited from has a C variadic constructor; the warning is
on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.
<DT id="670"><B>-Winline</B><DD>


Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.


<P>


The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <B>-Winline</B> to appear or disappear.
<DT id="671"><B>-Wno-invalid-offsetof</B> (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only)<DD>


Suppress warnings from applying the <TT>&quot;offsetof&quot;</TT> macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 2014 <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></FONT> standard, applying <TT>&quot;offsetof&quot;</TT>
to a non-standard-layout type is undefined.  In existing C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> implementations,
however, <TT>&quot;offsetof&quot;</TT> typically gives meaningful results.
This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.


<P>


The restrictions on <TT>&quot;offsetof&quot;</TT> may be relaxed in a future version
of the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> standard.
<DT id="672"><B>-Wint-in-bool-context</B><DD>


Warn for suspicious use of integer values where boolean values are expected,
such as conditional expressions (?:) using non-boolean integer constants in
boolean context, like <TT>&quot;if (a &lt;= b ? 2 : 3)&quot;</TT>.  Or left shifting of signed
integers in boolean context, like <TT>&quot;for (a = 0; 1 &lt;&lt; a; a++);&quot;</TT>.  Likewise
for all kinds of multiplications regardless of the data type.
This warning is enabled by <B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="673"><B>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast</B><DD>


Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
different size. In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, casting to a pointer type of smaller size is
an error. <B>Wint-to-pointer-cast</B> is enabled by default.
<DT id="674"><B>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
different size.
<DT id="675"><B>-Winvalid-pch</B><DD>


Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but cannot be used.
<DT id="676"><B>-Wlong-long</B><DD>


Warn if <TT>&quot;long long&quot;</TT> type is used.  This is enabled by either
<B>-Wpedantic</B> or <B>-Wtraditional</B> in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90</FONT> and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>98
modes.  To inhibit the warning messages, use <B>-Wno-long-long</B>.
<DT id="677"><B>-Wvariadic-macros</B><DD>


Warn if variadic macros are used in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90</FONT> mode, or if the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
alternate syntax is used in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99</FONT> mode.  This is enabled by either
<B>-Wpedantic</B> or <B>-Wtraditional</B>.  To inhibit the warning
messages, use <B>-Wno-variadic-macros</B>.
<DT id="678"><B>-Wvarargs</B><DD>


Warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle variable
arguments like <TT>&quot;va_start&quot;</TT>.  This is default.  To inhibit the
warning messages, use <B>-Wno-varargs</B>.
<DT id="679"><B>-Wvector-operation-performance</B><DD>


Warn if vector operation is not implemented via <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> capabilities of the
architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
Vector operation can be implemented <TT>&quot;piecewise&quot;</TT>, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 
<TT>&quot;in parallel&quot;</TT>, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and <TT>&quot;as a single scalar&quot;</TT>, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.
<DT id="680"><B>-Wno-virtual-move-assign</B><DD>


Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
non-trivial C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because
if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it is
moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the
moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is written to avoid
moving from a moved-from object, this warning can be disabled.
<DT id="681"><B>-Wvla</B><DD>


Warn if a variable-length array is used in the code.
<B>-Wno-vla</B> prevents the <B>-Wpedantic</B> warning of
the variable-length array.
<DT id="682"><B>-Wvla-larger-than=</B><I>byte-size</I><DD>


If this option is used, the compiler will warn for declarations of
variable-length arrays whose size is either unbounded, or bounded
by an argument that allows the array size to exceed <I>byte-size</I>
bytes.  This is similar to how <B>-Walloca-larger-than=</B><I>byte-size</I>
works, but with variable-length arrays.


<P>


Note that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may optimize small variable-length arrays of a known
value into plain arrays, so this warning may not get triggered for
such arrays.


<P>


<B>-Wvla-larger-than=</B><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PTRDIFF_MAX</B></FONT><B></B> is enabled by default but
is typically only effective when <B>-ftree-vrp</B> is active (default
for <B>-O2</B> and above).


<P>


See also <B>-Walloca-larger-than=</B><I>byte-size</I>.
<DT id="683"><B>-Wno-vla-larger-than</B><DD>


Disable <B>-Wvla-larger-than=</B> warnings.  The option is equivalent
to <B>-Wvla-larger-than=</B><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIZE_MAX</B></FONT><B></B> or larger.
<DT id="684"><B>-Wvolatile-register-var</B><DD>


Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled by
<B>-Wall</B>.
<DT id="685"><B>-Wdisabled-optimization</B><DD>


Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
<DT id="686"><B>-Wpointer-sign</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
<B>-Wall</B> and by <B>-Wpedantic</B>, which can be disabled with
<B>-Wno-pointer-sign</B>.
<DT id="687"><B>-Wstack-protector</B><DD>


This option is only active when <B>-fstack-protector</B> is active.  It
warns about functions that are not protected against stack smashing.
<DT id="688"><B>-Woverlength-strings</B><DD>


Warn about string constants that are longer than the ``minimum
maximum'' length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.


<P>


The limit applies <I>after</I> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing <FONT SIZE="-1">NUL.</FONT>  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.


<P>


This option is implied by <B>-Wpedantic</B>, and can be disabled with
<B>-Wno-overlength-strings</B>.
<DT id="689"><B>-Wunsuffixed-float-constants</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with <B>-Wsystem-headers</B> it
warns about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the <TT>&quot;FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64&quot;</TT> pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.
<DT id="690"><B>-Wno-designated-init</B> (C and Objective-C only)<DD>


Suppress warnings when a positional initializer is used to initialize
a structure that has been marked with the <TT>&quot;designated_init&quot;</TT>
attribute.
<DT id="691"><B>-Whsa</B><DD>


Issue a warning when <FONT SIZE="-1">HSAIL</FONT> cannot be emitted for the compiled function or
OpenMP construct.

<H3>Options for Debugging Your Program</H3>



To tell <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost 
all cases you need only to add <B>-g</B> to your other options.
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> allows you to use <B>-g</B> with
<B>-O</B>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
<P>

If you are not using some other optimization option, consider
using <B>-Og</B> with <B>-g</B>.  
With no <B>-O</B> option at all, some compiler passes that collect
information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that
<B>-Og</B> may result in a better debugging experience.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="692"><B>-g</B><DD>


Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, <FONT SIZE="-1">COFF, XCOFF,</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT>).  <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> can work with this debugging
information.


<P>


On most systems that use stabs format, <B>-g</B> enables use of extra
debugging information that only <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> but probably makes other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <B>-gstabs+</B>, <B>-gstabs</B>,

possible.
<DT id="694"><B>-gdwarf</B><DD>



<DT id="695"><B>-gdwarf-</B><I>version</I><DD>



Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> format (if that is supported).
The value of <I>version</I> may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version
for most targets is 4.  <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> Version 5 is only experimental.


<P>


Note that with <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> Version 2, some ports require and always
use some non-conflicting <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF 3</FONT> extensions in the unwind tables.


<P>


Version 4 may require <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB 7.0</FONT> and <B>-fvar-tracking-assignments</B>
for maximum benefit.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> no longer supports <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> Version 1, which is substantially
different than Version 2 and later.  For historical reasons, some
other DWARF-related options such as
<B>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</B>) retain a reference to <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> Version 2
in their names, but apply to all currently-supported versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF.</FONT>
<DT id="696"><B>-gstabs</B><DD>


Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> extensions.  This is the format used by <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> on most <FONT SIZE="-1">BSD</FONT>
systems.  On <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS,</FONT> Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX.</FONT>
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> assembler.
<DT id="697"><B>-gstabs+</B><DD>


Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions understood only by the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> debugger (<FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT>).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or

Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">XCOFF</FONT> format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the <FONT SIZE="-1">DBX</FONT> debugger on <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM RS/6000</FONT> systems.
<DT id="699"><B>-gxcoff+</B><DD>


Produce debugging information in <FONT SIZE="-1">XCOFF</FONT> format (if that is supported),
using <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions understood only by the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> debugger (<FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT>).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT>
assembler (<FONT SIZE="-1">GAS</FONT>) to fail with an error.
<DT id="700"><B>-gvms</B><DD>


Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by <FONT SIZE="-1">DEBUG</FONT> on Alpha/VMS systems.

<DT id="704"><B>-gxcoff</B><I>level</I><DD>


<DT id="705"><B>-gvms</B><I>level</I><DD>



Request debugging information and also use <I>level</I> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.


<P>


Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <B>-g0</B> negates
<B>-g</B>.


<P>


Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number
tables, but no information about local variables.


<P>


Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <B>-g3</B>.


<P>


If you use multiple <B>-g</B> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.


<P>


<B>-gdwarf</B> does not accept a concatenated debug level, to avoid
confusion with <B>-gdwarf-</B><I>level</I>.
Instead use an additional <B>-g</B><I>level</I> option to change the
debug level for <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF.</FONT>
<DT id="706"><B>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</B><DD>


Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
<DT id="707"><B>-femit-class-debug-always</B><DD>


Instead of emitting debugging information for a C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
<DT id="708"><B>-fno-merge-debug-strings</B><DD>


Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
information that are identical in different object files.  Merging is
not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging decreases the size
of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing
link processing time.  Merging is enabled by default.
<DT id="709"><B>-fdebug-prefix-map=</B><I>old</I><B>=</B><I>new</I><DD>


When compiling files residing in directory <I>old</I>, record
debugging information describing them as if the files resided in
directory <I>new</I> instead.  This can be used to replace a
build-time path with an install-time path in the debug info.  It can
also be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by using
<I>.</I> for <I>new</I>.  This can give more reproducible builds, which
are location independent, but may require an extra command to tell <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT>
where to find the source files. See also <B>-ffile-prefix-map</B>.
<DT id="710"><B>-fvar-tracking</B><DD>


Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each
position in code.  Better debugging information is then generated
(if the debugging information format supports this information).


<P>


It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<B>-Os</B>,
<B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, ...), debugging information (<B>-g</B>) and
the debug info format supports it.
<DT id="711"><B>-fvar-tracking-assignments</B><DD>


Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and
attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the
way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while
optimizing.  Use of <B>-gdwarf-4</B> is recommended along with it.


<P>


It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case
annotations are created and maintained, but discarded at the end.
By default, this flag is enabled together with <B>-fvar-tracking</B>,
except when selective scheduling is enabled.
<DT id="712"><B>-gsplit-dwarf</B><DD>


Separate as much <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> debugging information as possible into a
separate output file with the extension <I>.dwo</I>.  This option allows
the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading <I>.dwo</I>
files.
<DT id="713"><B>-gdescribe-dies</B><DD>


Add description attributes to some <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> DIEs that have no name attribute,
such as artificial variables, external references and call site
parameter DIEs.
<DT id="714"><B>-gpubnames</B><DD>


Generate <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> <TT>&quot;.debug_pubnames&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;.debug_pubtypes&quot;</TT> sections.
<DT id="715"><B>-ggnu-pubnames</B><DD>


Generate <TT>&quot;.debug_pubnames&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;.debug_pubtypes&quot;</TT> sections in a format
suitable for conversion into a <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> index.  This option is only useful
with a linker that can produce <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> index version 7.
<DT id="716"><B>-fdebug-types-section</B><DD>


When using <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
their own <TT>&quot;.debug_types&quot;</TT> section instead of making them part of the
<TT>&quot;.debug_info&quot;</TT> section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat section since the linker can then remove duplicates.
But not all <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> consumers support <TT>&quot;.debug_types&quot;</TT> sections yet
and on some objects <TT>&quot;.debug_types&quot;</TT> produces larger instead of smaller
debugging information.
<DT id="717"><B>-grecord-gcc-switches</B><DD>



<DT id="718"><B>-gno-record-gcc-switches</B><DD>



This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version.  
It is enabled by default.
See also <B>-frecord-gcc-switches</B> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
<DT id="719"><B>-gstrict-dwarf</B><DD>


Disallow using extensions of later <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> standard version than selected
with <B>-gdwarf-</B><I>version</I>.  On most targets using non-conflicting
<FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> extensions from later standard versions is allowed.
<DT id="720"><B>-gno-strict-dwarf</B><DD>


Allow using extensions of later <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> standard version than selected with
<B>-gdwarf-</B><I>version</I>.
<DT id="721"><B>-gas-loc-support</B><DD>


Inform the compiler that the assembler supports <TT>&quot;.loc&quot;</TT> directives.
It may then use them for the assembler to generate <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2+</FONT> line number
tables.


<P>


This is generally desirable, because assembler-generated line-number
tables are a lot more compact than those the compiler can generate
itself.


<P>


This option will be enabled by default if, at <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> configure time, the
assembler was found to support such directives.
<DT id="722"><B>-gno-as-loc-support</B><DD>


Force <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2+</FONT> line number tables internally, if <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF2+</FONT>
line number tables are to be generated.
<DT id="723"><B>gas-locview-support</B><DD>


Inform the compiler that the assembler supports <TT>&quot;view&quot;</TT> assignment
and reset assertion checking in <TT>&quot;.loc&quot;</TT> directives.


<P>


This option will be enabled by default if, at <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> configure time, the
assembler was found to support them.
<DT id="724"><B>gno-as-locview-support</B><DD>


Force <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to assign view numbers internally, if
<B>-gvariable-location-views</B> are explicitly requested.
<DT id="725"><B>-gcolumn-info</B><DD>



<DT id="726"><B>-gno-column-info</B><DD>



Emit location column information into <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> debugging information, rather
than just file and line.
This option is enabled by default.
<DT id="727"><B>-gstatement-frontiers</B><DD>



<DT id="728"><B>-gno-statement-frontiers</B><DD>



This option causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to create markers in the internal representation
at the beginning of statements, and to keep them roughly in place
throughout compilation, using them to guide the output of <TT>&quot;is_stmt&quot;</TT>
markers in the line number table.  This is enabled by default when
compiling with optimization (<B>-Os</B>, <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>,
...), and outputting <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF 2</FONT> debug information at the normal level.
<DT id="729"><B>-gvariable-location-views</B><DD>



<DT id="730"><B>-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</B><DD>


<DT id="731"><B>-gno-variable-location-views</B><DD>



Augment variable location lists with progressive view numbers implied
from the line number table.  This enables debug information consumers to
inspect state at certain points of the program, even if no instructions
associated with the corresponding source locations are present at that
point.  If the assembler lacks support for view numbers in line number
tables, this will cause the compiler to emit the line number table,
which generally makes them somewhat less compact.  The augmented line
number tables and location lists are fully backward-compatible, so they
can be consumed by debug information consumers that are not aware of
these augmentations, but they won't derive any benefit from them either.


<P>


This is enabled by default when outputting <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF 2</FONT> debug information at
the normal level, as long as there is assembler support,
<B>-fvar-tracking-assignments</B> is enabled and
<B>-gstrict-dwarf</B> is not.  When assembler support is not
available, this may still be enabled, but it will force <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to output
internal line number tables, and if
<B>-ginternal-reset-location-views</B> is not enabled, that will most
certainly lead to silently mismatching location views.


<P>


There is a proposed representation for view numbers that is not backward
compatible with the location list format introduced in <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF 5,</FONT> that can
be enabled with <B>-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</B>.  This
option may be removed in the future, is only provided as a reference
implementation of the proposed representation.  Debug information
consumers are not expected to support this extended format, and they
would be rendered unable to decode location lists using it.
<DT id="732"><B>-ginternal-reset-location-views</B><DD>



<DT id="733"><B>-gno-internal-reset-location-views</B><DD>



Attempt to determine location views that can be omitted from location
view lists.  This requires the compiler to have very accurate insn
length estimates, which isn't always the case, and it may cause
incorrect view lists to be generated silently when using an assembler
that does not support location view lists.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> assembler will flag
any such error as a <TT>&quot;view number mismatch&quot;</TT>.  This is only enabled
on ports that define a reliable estimation function.
<DT id="734"><B>-ginline-points</B><DD>



<DT id="735"><B>-gno-inline-points</B><DD>



Generate extended debug information for inlined functions.  Location
view tracking markers are inserted at inlined entry points, so that
address and view numbers can be computed and output in debug
information.  This can be enabled independently of location views, in
which case the view numbers won't be output, but it can only be enabled
along with statement frontiers, and it is only enabled by default if
location views are enabled.
<DT id="736"><B>-gz</B>[<B>=</B><I>type</I>]<DD>


Produce compressed debug sections in <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> format, if that is supported.
If <I>type</I> is not given, the default type depends on the capabilities
of the assembler and linker used.  <I>type</I> may be one of
<B>none</B> (don't compress debug sections), <B>zlib</B> (use zlib
compression in <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> gABI format), or <B>zlib-gnu</B> (use zlib
compression in traditional <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> format).  If the linker doesn't support
writing compressed debug sections, the option is rejected.  Otherwise,
if the assembler does not support them, <B>-gz</B> is silently ignored
when producing object files.
<DT id="737"><B>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</B><DD>


Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the struct is defined.


<P>


This option substantially reduces the size of debugging information,
but at significant potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See <B>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</B> for a less aggressive option.
See <B>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</B> for more detailed control.


<P>


This option works only with <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> debug output.
<DT id="738"><B>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</B><DD>


Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the type is defined,
unless the struct is a template or defined in a system header.


<P>


This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information,
with some potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See <B>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</B> for a more aggressive option.
See <B>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</B> for more detailed control.


<P>


This option works only with <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> debug output.
<DT id="739"><B>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</B>[<B>=</B><I>spec-list</I>]<DD>


Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler generates debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.


<P>


This option is a detailed version of
<B>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</B> and <B>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</B>,
which serves for most needs.


<P>


A specification has the syntax[<B>dir:</B>|<B>ind:</B>][<B>ord:</B>|<B>gen:</B>](<B>any</B>|<B>sys</B>|<B>base</B>|<B>none</B>)


<P>


The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (<B>dir:</B>) or used indirectly (<B>ind:</B>).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect.
An example is
<B>struct one direct; struct two * indirect;</B>.


<P>


The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (<B>ord:</B>) or generic structs (<B>gen:</B>).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but <B>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</B> does not yet implement them.


<P>


The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information.
The values <B>none</B> and <B>any</B> have the normal meaning.
The value <B>base</B> means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that when compiling <I>foo.c</I>, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and <I>foo.h</I>,
but not other header files.
The value <B>sys</B> means those types satisfying <B>base</B>
or declared in system or compiler headers.


<P>


You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.


<P>


The default is <B>-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</B>.


<P>


This option works only with <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> debug output.
<DT id="740"><B>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</B><DD>


Emit <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> unwind info as compiler generated <TT>&quot;.eh_frame&quot;</TT> section
instead of using <FONT SIZE="-1">GAS</FONT> <TT>&quot;.cfi_*&quot;</TT> directives.
<DT id="741"><B>-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types</B><DD>


Normally, when producing <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> output, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> avoids producing debug symbol 
output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
Sometimes it is useful to have <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example 
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Options That Control Optimization</H3>



These options control various sorts of optimizations.
<P>

Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.
<P>

Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
<P>

The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
<P>

Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
<P>

Most optimizations are completely disabled at <B>-O0</B> or if an
<B>-O</B> level is not set on the command line, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.  Similarly, <B>-Og</B> suppresses
many optimization passes.
<P>

Depending on the target and how <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <B>-O</B> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with <B>-Q --help=optimizers</B>
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="742"><B>-O</B><DD>



<DT id="743"><B>-O1</B><DD>



Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.


<P>


With <B>-O</B>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution

As compared to <B>-O</B>, this option increases both compilation time

Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected

<DT id="747"><B>-Os</B><DD>


Optimize for size.  <B>-Os</B> enables all <B>-O2</B> optimizations 
except those that often increase code size:


<P>


<B>-falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
-falign-labels  -falign-loops 
-fprefetch-loop-arrays  -freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc</B>


<P>


It also enables <B>-finline-functions</B>, causes the compiler to tune for
code size rather than execution speed, and performs further optimizations
designed to reduce code size.
<DT id="748"><B>-Ofast</B><DD>


Disregard strict standards compliance.  <B>-Ofast</B> enables all
<B>-O3</B> optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard-compliant programs.
It turns on <B>-ffast-math</B> and the Fortran-specific
<B>-fstack-arrays</B>, unless <B>-fmax-stack-var-size</B> is
specified, and <B>-fno-protect-parens</B>.
<DT id="749"><B>-Og</B><DD>


Optimize debugging experience.  <B>-Og</B> should be the optimization
level of choice for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering
a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation
and a good debugging experience.  It is a better choice than <B>-O0</B>
for producing debuggable code because some compiler passes
that collect debug information are disabled at <B>-O0</B>.


<P>


Like <B>-O0</B>, <B>-Og</B> completely disables a number of

<DT id="750"><B>-fno-defer-pop</B><DD>


For machines that must pop arguments after a function call, always pop 
the arguments as soon as each function returns.  
At levels <B>-O1</B> and higher, <B>-fdefer-pop</B> is the default;
this allows the compiler to let arguments accumulate on the stack for several

<DT id="751"><B>-fforward-propagate</B><DD>


Perform a forward propagation pass on <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL.</FONT>  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.


<P>


This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <B>-O</B>,
<B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="752"><B>-ffp-contract=</B><I>style</I><DD>


<B>-ffp-contract=off</B> disables floating-point expression contraction.
<B>-ffp-contract=fast</B> enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
<B>-ffp-contract=on</B> enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to <B>-ffp-contract=off</B>.


<P>


The default is <B>-ffp-contract=fast</B>.
<DT id="753"><B>-fomit-frame-pointer</B><DD>


Omit the frame pointer in functions that don't need one.  This avoids the
instructions to save, set up and restore the frame pointer; on many targets
it also makes an extra register available.


<P>


On some targets this flag has no effect because the standard calling sequence
always uses a frame pointer, so it cannot be omitted.


<P>


Note that <B>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</B> doesn't guarantee the frame pointer
is used in all functions.  Several targets always omit the frame pointer in
leaf functions.


<P>


Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="754"><B>-foptimize-sibling-calls</B><DD>


Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="755"><B>-foptimize-strlen</B><DD>


Optimize various standard C string functions (e.g. <TT>&quot;strlen&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;strchr&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;strcpy&quot;</TT>) and
their <TT>&quot;_FORTIFY_SOURCE&quot;</TT> counterparts into faster alternatives.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>.
<DT id="756"><B>-fno-inline</B><DD>


Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with
the <TT>&quot;always_inline&quot;</TT> attribute.  This is the default when not
optimizing.


<P>


Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them
with the <TT>&quot;noinline&quot;</TT> attribute.
<DT id="757"><B>-finline-small-functions</B><DD>


Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating
in this way.  This inlining applies to all functions, even those not declared
inline.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="758"><B>-findirect-inlining</B><DD>


Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at compile
time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the <B>-finline-functions</B>
or <B>-finline-small-functions</B> options.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="759"><B>-finline-functions</B><DD>


Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not declared inline.
The compiler heuristically decides which functions are worth integrating
in this way.


<P>


If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.  Also enabled
by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="760"><B>-finline-functions-called-once</B><DD>


Consider all <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O1</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B> and <B>-Os</B>,
but not <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="761"><B>-fearly-inlining</B><DD>


Inline functions marked by <TT>&quot;always_inline&quot;</TT> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<B>-fprofile-generate</B> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.


<P>


Enabled by default.
<DT id="762"><B>-fipa-sra</B><DD>


Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal of
unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by reference
by parameters passed by value.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B> and <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="763"><B>-finline-limit=</B><I>n</I><DD>


By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  <I>n</I> is the size of functions that
can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.


<P>


Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <B>--param</B> <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>value</I>.
The <B>-finline-limit=</B><I>n</I> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="764"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="765"><B>max-inline-insns-single</B><DD>


is set to <I>n</I>/2.
<DT id="766"><B>max-inline-insns-auto</B><DD>


is set to <I>n</I>/2.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="767"><DD>


<P>


See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> there may be no value to <B>-finline-limit</B> that results
in default behavior.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.
</DL>

<DT id="768"><B>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</B><DD>


This is a more fine-grained version of <B>-fkeep-inline-functions</B>,
which applies only to functions that are declared using the <TT>&quot;dllexport&quot;</TT>
attribute or declspec.
<DT id="769"><B>-fkeep-inline-functions</B><DD>


In C, emit <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> functions that are declared <TT>&quot;inline&quot;</TT>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<TT>&quot;extern inline&quot;</TT> extension in <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU C90.</FONT>  In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.
<DT id="770"><B>-fkeep-static-functions</B><DD>


Emit <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> functions into the object file, even if the function
is never used.
<DT id="771"><B>-fkeep-static-consts</B><DD>


Emit variables declared <TT>&quot;static const&quot;</TT> when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if a variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <B>-fno-keep-static-consts</B> option.
<DT id="772"><B>-fmerge-constants</B><DD>


Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.


<P>


This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <B>-fno-merge-constants</B> to inhibit this
behavior.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="773"><B>-fmerge-all-constants</B><DD>


Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.


<P>


This option implies <B>-fmerge-constants</B>.  In addition to
<B>-fmerge-constants</B> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option results in non-conforming
behavior.
<DT id="774"><B>-fmodulo-sched</B><DD>


Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
<DT id="775"><B>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</B><DD>


Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges are
deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
<B>-fmodulo-sched</B> enabled.
<DT id="776"><B>-fno-branch-count-reg</B><DD>


Disable the optimization pass that scans for opportunities to use 
``decrement and branch'' instructions on a count register instead of
instruction sequences that decrement a register, compare it against zero, and
then branch based upon the result.  This option is only meaningful on
architectures that support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC,
<FONT SIZE="-1">IA-64</FONT> and S/390.  Note that the <B>-fno-branch-count-reg</B> option
doesn't remove the decrement and branch instructions from the generated
instruction stream introduced by other optimization passes.


<P>


The default is <B>-fbranch-count-reg</B> at <B>-O1</B> and higher,
except for <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="777"><B>-fno-function-cse</B><DD>


Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.


<P>


This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.


<P>


The default is <B>-ffunction-cse</B>
<DT id="778"><B>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</B><DD>


If the target supports a <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> section, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS.</FONT>  This can save space in the resulting
code.


<P>


This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section---e.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.


<P>


The default is <B>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</B>.
<DT id="779"><B>-fthread-jumps</B><DD>


Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="780"><B>-fsplit-wide-types</B><DD>


When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as <TT>&quot;long
long&quot;</TT> on a 32-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently.  This normally generates better code for those types,
but may make debugging more difficult.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>,
<B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="781"><B>-fcse-follow-jumps</B><DD>


In common subexpression elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT>), scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> encounters an <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement with an
<TT>&quot;else&quot;</TT> clause, <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> follows the jump when the condition
tested is false.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="782"><B>-fcse-skip-blocks</B><DD>


This is similar to <B>-fcse-follow-jumps</B>, but causes <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> to
follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks.  When <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT>
encounters a simple <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement with no else clause,
<B>-fcse-skip-blocks</B> causes <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> to follow the jump around the
body of the <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="783"><B>-frerun-cse-after-loop</B><DD>


Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations are
performed.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="784"><B>-fgcse</B><DD>


Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.


<P>


<I>Note:</I> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
extension, you may get better run-time performance if you disable
the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
<B>-fno-gcse</B> to the command line.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="785"><B>-fgcse-lm</B><DD>


When <B>-fgcse-lm</B> is enabled, global common subexpression elimination
attempts to move loads that are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.


<P>


Enabled by default when <B>-fgcse</B> is enabled.
<DT id="786"><B>-fgcse-sm</B><DD>


When <B>-fgcse-sm</B> is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass attempts to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with <B>-fgcse-lm</B>,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.


<P>


Not enabled at any optimization level.
<DT id="787"><B>-fgcse-las</B><DD>


When <B>-fgcse-las</B> is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).


<P>


Not enabled at any optimization level.
<DT id="788"><B>-fgcse-after-reload</B><DD>


When <B>-fgcse-after-reload</B> is enabled, a redundant load elimination
pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to clean up
redundant spilling.


<P>


Enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="789"><B>-faggressive-loop-optimizations</B><DD>


This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed
integer overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.  The bounds for the
number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling
and loop exit test optimizations.
This option is enabled by default.
<DT id="790"><B>-funconstrained-commons</B><DD>


This option tells the compiler that variables declared in common blocks
(e.g. Fortran) may later be overridden with longer trailing arrays. This
prevents certain optimizations that depend on knowing the array bounds.
<DT id="791"><B>-fcrossjumping</B><DD>


Perform cross-jumping transformation.
This transformation unifies equivalent code and saves code size.  The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="792"><B>-fauto-inc-dec</B><DD>


Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.
This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and
higher on architectures that support this.
<DT id="793"><B>-fdce</B><DD>


Perform dead code elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">DCE</FONT>) on <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL.</FONT>
Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="794"><B>-fdse</B><DD>


Perform dead store elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">DSE</FONT>) on <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL.</FONT>
Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="795"><B>-fif-conversion</B><DD>


Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This
includes use of conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and
some tricks doable by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution
on chips where it is available is controlled by <B>-fif-conversion2</B>.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>, but
not with <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="796"><B>-fif-conversion2</B><DD>


Use conditional execution (where available) to transform conditional jumps into
branch-less equivalents.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>, but
not with <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="797"><B>-fdeclone-ctor-dtor</B><DD>


The C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> requires multiple entry points for constructors and
destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a complete object, and
one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete afterwards.
For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are
clones, which means two copies of the function.  With this option, the
base and complete variants are changed to be thunks that call a common
implementation.


<P>


Enabled by <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="798"><B>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</B><DD>


Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides at address zero.
This option enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that a memory access to address zero always results in a trap, so
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.


<P>


Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use <B>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</B> to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that behavior.


<P>


This option is enabled by default on most targets.  On Nios <FONT SIZE="-1">II ELF,</FONT> it
defaults to off.  On <FONT SIZE="-1">AVR, CR16,</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">MSP430,</FONT> this option is completely disabled.


<P>


Passes that use the dataflow information
are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
<DT id="799"><B>-fdevirtualize</B><DD>


Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.  This
is done both within a procedure and interprocedurally as part of
indirect inlining (<B>-findirect-inlining</B>) and interprocedural constant
propagation (<B>-fipa-cp</B>).
Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="800"><B>-fdevirtualize-speculatively</B><DD>


Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative direct calls.
Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call
the set of likely targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect calls.  The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem
useless after further optimization, they are converted back into original form.
<DT id="801"><B>-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans</B><DD>


Stream extra information needed for aggressive devirtualization when running
the link-time optimizer in local transformation mode.  
This option enables more devirtualization but
significantly increases the size of streamed data. For this reason it is
disabled by default.
<DT id="802"><B>-fexpensive-optimizations</B><DD>


Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="803"><B>-free</B><DD>


Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions.  This is especially
helpful for the x86-64 architecture, which implicitly zero-extends in 64-bit
registers after writing to their lower 32-bit half.


<P>


Enabled for Alpha, AArch64 and x86 at levels <B>-O2</B>,
<B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="804"><B>-fno-lifetime-dse</B><DD>


In C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> the value of an object is only affected by changes within its
lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object has an indeterminate
value, and any changes during the lifetime of the object are dead when
the object is destroyed.  Normally dead store elimination will take
advantage of this; if your code relies on the value of the object
storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you can use this
flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores before the
constructor starts (e.g. because your operator new clears the object
storage) but still treat the object as dead after the destructor you,
can use <B>-flifetime-dse=1</B>.  The default behavior can be
explicitly selected with <B>-flifetime-dse=2</B>.
<B>-flifetime-dse=0</B> is equivalent to <B>-fno-lifetime-dse</B>.
<DT id="805"><B>-flive-range-shrinkage</B><DD>


Attempt to decrease register pressure through register live range
shrinkage.  This is helpful for fast processors with small or moderate
size register sets.
<DT id="806"><B>-fira-algorithm=</B><I>algorithm</I><DD>


Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
allocator.  The <I>algorithm</I> argument can be <B>priority</B>, which
specifies Chow's priority coloring, or <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CB</B></FONT><B></B>, which specifies
Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not implemented
for all architectures, but for those targets that do support it, it is
the default because it generates better code.
<DT id="807"><B>-fira-region=</B><I>region</I><DD>


Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
<I>region</I> argument should be one of the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="808"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="809"><B>all</B><DD>


Use all loops as register allocation regions.
This can give the best results for machines with a small and/or
irregular register set.
<DT id="810"><B>mixed</B><DD>


Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure 
as the regions.  This value usually gives
the best results in most cases and for most architectures,
and is enabled by default when compiling with optimization for speed
(<B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, ...).
<DT id="811"><B>one</B><DD>


Use all functions as a single region.  
This typically results in the smallest code size, and is enabled by default for
<B>-Os</B> or <B>-O0</B>.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="812"><DD>
</DL>

<DT id="813"><B>-fira-hoist-pressure</B><DD>


Use <FONT SIZE="-1">IRA</FONT> to evaluate register pressure in the code hoisting pass for
decisions to hoist expressions.  This option usually results in smaller
code, but it can slow the compiler down.


<P>


This option is enabled at level <B>-Os</B> for all targets.
<DT id="814"><B>-fira-loop-pressure</B><DD>


Use <FONT SIZE="-1">IRA</FONT> to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to move
loop invariants.  This option usually results in generation
of faster and smaller code on machines with large register files (&gt;= 32
registers), but it can slow the compiler down.


<P>


This option is enabled at level <B>-O3</B> for some targets.
<DT id="815"><B>-fno-ira-share-save-slots</B><DD>


Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard
registers living through a call.  Each hard register gets a
separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are
larger.
<DT id="816"><B>-fno-ira-share-spill-slots</B><DD>


Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.  Each
pseudo-register that does not get a hard register gets a separate
stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are larger.
<DT id="817"><B>-flra-remat</B><DD>


Enable CFG-sensitive rematerialization in <FONT SIZE="-1">LRA.</FONT>  Instead of loading
values of spilled pseudos, <FONT SIZE="-1">LRA</FONT> tries to rematerialize (recalculate)
values if it is profitable.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="818"><B>-fdelayed-branch</B><DD>


If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions
to exploit instruction slots available after delayed branch
instructions.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>,
but not at <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="819"><B>-fschedule-insns</B><DD>


If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating-point instruction is required.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>.
<DT id="820"><B>-fschedule-insns2</B><DD>


Similar to <B>-fschedule-insns</B>, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of
registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="821"><B>-fno-sched-interblock</B><DD>


Disable instruction scheduling across basic blocks, which
is normally enabled when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.
with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="822"><B>-fno-sched-spec</B><DD>


Disable speculative motion of non-load instructions, which
is normally enabled when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.
with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="823"><B>-fsched-pressure</B><DD>


Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before register
allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling before register
allocation is enabled, i.e. with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at
<B>-O2</B> or higher.  Usage of this option can improve the
generated code and decrease its size by preventing register pressure
increase above the number of available hard registers and subsequent
spills in register allocation.
<DT id="824"><B>-fsched-spec-load</B><DD>


Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This only makes
sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
<B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="825"><B>-fsched-spec-load-dangerous</B><DD>


Allow speculative motion of more load instructions.  This only makes
sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
<B>-fschedule-insns</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="826"><B>-fsched-stalled-insns</B><DD>



<DT id="827"><B>-fsched-stalled-insns=</B><I>n</I><DD>



Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from the queue
of stalled insns into the ready list during the second scheduling pass.
<B>-fno-sched-stalled-insns</B> means that no insns are moved
prematurely, <B>-fsched-stalled-insns=0</B> means there is no limit
on how many queued insns can be moved prematurely.
<B>-fsched-stalled-insns</B> without a value is equivalent to
<B>-fsched-stalled-insns=1</B>.
<DT id="828"><B>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep</B><DD>



<DT id="829"><B>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=</B><I>n</I><DD>



Define how many insn groups (cycles) are examined for a dependency
on a stalled insn that is a candidate for premature removal from the queue
of stalled insns.  This has an effect only during the second scheduling pass,
and only if <B>-fsched-stalled-insns</B> is used.
<B>-fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep</B> is equivalent to
<B>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0</B>.
<B>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep</B> without a value is equivalent to
<B>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1</B>.
<DT id="830"><B>-fsched2-use-superblocks</B><DD>


When scheduling after register allocation, use superblock scheduling.
This allows motion across basic block boundaries,
resulting in faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> model the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> closely enough to avoid unreliable
results from the algorithm.


<P>


This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with
<B>-fschedule-insns2</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="831"><B>-fsched-group-heuristic</B><DD>


Enable the group heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors
the instruction that belongs to a schedule group.  This is enabled
by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <B>-fschedule-insns</B>
or <B>-fschedule-insns2</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="832"><B>-fsched-critical-path-heuristic</B><DD>


Enable the critical-path heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors
instructions on the critical path.  This is enabled by default when
scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <B>-fschedule-insns</B>
or <B>-fschedule-insns2</B> or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="833"><B>-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic</B><DD>


Enable the speculative instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This
heuristic favors speculative instructions with greater dependency weakness.
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e.
with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or <B>-fschedule-insns2</B>
or at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="834"><B>-fsched-rank-heuristic</B><DD>


Enable the rank heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors
the instruction belonging to a basic block with greater size or frequency.
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e.
with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or <B>-fschedule-insns2</B> or
at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="835"><B>-fsched-last-insn-heuristic</B><DD>


Enable the last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic
favors the instruction that is less dependent on the last instruction
scheduled.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled,
i.e. with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or <B>-fschedule-insns2</B> or
at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="836"><B>-fsched-dep-count-heuristic</B><DD>


Enable the dependent-count heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic
favors the instruction that has more instructions depending on it.
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e.
with <B>-fschedule-insns</B> or <B>-fschedule-insns2</B> or
at <B>-O2</B> or higher.
<DT id="837"><B>-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops</B><DD>


Modulo scheduling is performed before traditional scheduling.  If a loop
is modulo scheduled, later scheduling passes may change its schedule.  
Use this option to control that behavior.
<DT id="838"><B>-fselective-scheduling</B><DD>


Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.  Selective
scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler pass.
<DT id="839"><B>-fselective-scheduling2</B><DD>


Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.  Selective
scheduling runs instead of the second scheduler pass.
<DT id="840"><B>-fsel-sched-pipelining</B><DD>


Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during selective scheduling.
This option has no effect unless one of <B>-fselective-scheduling</B> or
<B>-fselective-scheduling2</B> is turned on.
<DT id="841"><B>-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops</B><DD>


When pipelining loops during selective scheduling, also pipeline outer loops.
This option has no effect unless <B>-fsel-sched-pipelining</B> is turned on.
<DT id="842"><B>-fsemantic-interposition</B><DD>


Some object formats, like <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF,</FONT> allow interposing of symbols by the 
dynamic linker.
This means that for symbols exported from the <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO,</FONT> the compiler cannot perform
interprocedural propagation, inlining and other optimizations in anticipation
that the function or variable in question may change. While this feature is
useful, for example, to rewrite memory allocation functions by a debugging
implementation, it is expensive in the terms of code quality.
With <B>-fno-semantic-interposition</B> the compiler assumes that 
if interposition happens for functions the overwriting function will have 
precisely the same semantics (and side effects). 
Similarly if interposition happens
for variables, the constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag
has no effect for functions explicitly declared inline 
(where it is never allowed for interposition to change semantics) 
and for symbols explicitly declared weak.
<DT id="843"><B>-fshrink-wrap</B><DD>


Emit function prologues only before parts of the function that need it,
rather than at the top of the function.  This flag is enabled by default at
<B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="844"><B>-fshrink-wrap-separate</B><DD>


Shrink-wrap separate parts of the prologue and epilogue separately, so that
those parts are only executed when needed.
This option is on by default, but has no effect unless <B>-fshrink-wrap</B>
is also turned on and the target supports this.
<DT id="845"><B>-fcaller-saves</B><DD>


Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code.


<P>


This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="846"><B>-fcombine-stack-adjustments</B><DD>


Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory references
and then tries to find ways to combine them.


<P>


Enabled by default at <B>-O1</B> and higher.
<DT id="847"><B>-fipa-ra</B><DD>


Use caller save registers for allocation if those registers are not used by
any called function.  In that case it is not necessary to save and restore
them around calls.  This is only possible if called functions are part of
same compilation unit as current function and they are compiled before it.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>, however the option
is disabled if generated code will be instrumented for profiling
(<B>-p</B>, or <B>-pg</B>) or if callee's register usage cannot be known
exactly (this happens on targets that do not expose prologues
and epilogues in <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT>).
<DT id="848"><B>-fconserve-stack</B><DD>


Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to use less
stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This option
implies setting the <B>large-stack-frame</B> parameter to 100
and the <B>large-stack-frame-growth</B> parameter to 400.
<DT id="849"><B>-ftree-reassoc</B><DD>


Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="850"><B>-fcode-hoisting</B><DD>


Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the
evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the function exit
as early as possible.  This is especially useful as a code size
optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well.
This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O2</B> and higher.
<DT id="851"><B>-ftree-pre</B><DD>


Perform partial redundancy elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">PRE</FONT>) on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at <B>-O2</B> and <B>-O3</B>.
<DT id="852"><B>-ftree-partial-pre</B><DD>


Make partial redundancy elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">PRE</FONT>) more aggressive.  This flag is
enabled by default at <B>-O3</B>.
<DT id="853"><B>-ftree-forwprop</B><DD>


Perform forward propagation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="854"><B>-ftree-fre</B><DD>


Perform full redundancy elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">FRE</FONT>) on trees.  The difference
between <FONT SIZE="-1">FRE</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">PRE</FONT> is that <FONT SIZE="-1">FRE</FONT> only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than <FONT SIZE="-1">PRE,</FONT> though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="855"><B>-ftree-phiprop</B><DD>


Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This
pass is enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="856"><B>-fhoist-adjacent-loads</B><DD>


Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an if-then-else if the
loads are from adjacent locations in the same structure and the target
architecture has a conditional move instruction.  This flag is enabled
by default at <B>-O2</B> and higher.
<DT id="857"><B>-ftree-copy-prop</B><DD>


Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary
copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and
higher.
<DT id="858"><B>-fipa-pure-const</B><DD>


Discover which functions are pure or constant.
Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="859"><B>-fipa-reference</B><DD>


Discover which static variables do not escape the
compilation unit.
Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="860"><B>-fipa-reference-addressable</B><DD>


Discover read-only, write-only and non-addressable static variables.
Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="861"><B>-fipa-stack-alignment</B><DD>


Reduce stack alignment on call sites if possible.
Enabled by default.
<DT id="862"><B>-fipa-pta</B><DD>


Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.
<DT id="863"><B>-fipa-profile</B><DD>


Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
<TT>&quot;cold&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT>, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="864"><B>-fipa-cp</B><DD>


Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O2</B>, <B>-Os</B> and <B>-O3</B>.
It is also enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="865"><B>-fipa-cp-clone</B><DD>


Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see <B>--param ipcp-unit-growth=</B><I>value</I>).
This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O3</B>.
It is also enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="866"><B>-fipa-bit-cp</B><DD>


When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
propagation. This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O2</B> and
by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
It requires that <B>-fipa-cp</B> is enabled.
<DT id="867"><B>-fipa-vrp</B><DD>


When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value
ranges. This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O2</B>. It requires
that <B>-fipa-cp</B> is enabled.
<DT id="868"><B>-fipa-icf</B><DD>


Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only variables.
The optimization reduces code size and may disturb unwind stacks by replacing
a function by equivalent one with a different name. The optimization works
more effectively with link-time optimization enabled.


<P>


Although the behavior is similar to the Gold Linker's <FONT SIZE="-1">ICF</FONT> optimization, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC ICF</FONT>
works on different levels and thus the optimizations are not same - there are
equivalences that are found only by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> and equivalences found only by Gold.


<P>


This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O2</B> and <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="869"><B>-flive-patching=</B><I>level</I><DD>


Control <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s optimizations to produce output suitable for live-patching.


<P>


If the compiler's optimization uses a function's body or information extracted
from its body to optimize/change another function, the latter is called an
impacted function of the former.  If a function is patched, its impacted
functions should be patched too.


<P>


The impacted functions are determined by the compiler's interprocedural
optimizations.  For example, a caller is impacted when inlining a function
into its caller,
cloning a function and changing its caller to call this new clone,
or extracting a function's pureness/constness information to optimize
its direct or indirect callers, etc.


<P>


Usually, the more <FONT SIZE="-1">IPA</FONT> optimizations enabled, the larger the number of
impacted functions for each function.  In order to control the number of
impacted functions and more easily compute the list of impacted function,
<FONT SIZE="-1">IPA</FONT> optimizations can be partially enabled at two different levels.


<P>


The <I>level</I> argument should be one of the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="870"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="871"><B>inline-clone</B><DD>


Only enable inlining and cloning optimizations, which includes inlining,
cloning, interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates and partial inlining.
As a result, when patching a function, all its callers and its clones'
callers are impacted, therefore need to be patched as well.


<P>


<B>-flive-patching=inline-clone</B> disables the following optimization flags:
<B>-fwhole-program  -fipa-pta  -fipa-reference  -fipa-ra 
-fipa-icf  -fipa-icf-functions  -fipa-icf-variables 
-fipa-bit-cp  -fipa-vrp  -fipa-pure-const  -fipa-reference-addressable 
-fipa-stack-alignment</B>
<DT id="872"><B>inline-only-static</B><DD>


Only enable inlining of static functions.
As a result, when patching a static function, all its callers are impacted
and so need to be patched as well.


<P>


In addition to all the flags that <B>-flive-patching=inline-clone</B>
disables,
<B>-flive-patching=inline-only-static</B> disables the following additional
optimization flags:
<B>-fipa-cp-clone  -fipa-sra  -fpartial-inlining  -fipa-cp</B>
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="873"><DD>


<P>


When <B>-flive-patching</B> is specified without any value, the default value
is <I>inline-clone</I>.


<P>


This flag is disabled by default.


<P>


Note that <B>-flive-patching</B> is not supported with link-time optimization
(<B>-flto</B>).
</DL>

<DT id="874"><B>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference</B><DD>


Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due to
dereferencing a null pointer.  Isolate those paths from the main control
flow and turn the statement with erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap.
This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O2</B> and higher and depends on
<B>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</B> also being enabled.
<DT id="875"><B>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute</B><DD>


Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due to a null value
being used in a way forbidden by a <TT>&quot;returns_nonnull&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;nonnull&quot;</TT>
attribute.  Isolate those paths from the main control flow and turn the
statement with erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap.  This is not
currently enabled, but may be enabled by <B>-O2</B> in the future.
<DT id="876"><B>-ftree-sink</B><DD>


Perform forward store motion on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="877"><B>-ftree-bit-ccp</B><DD>


Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees and propagate
pointer alignment information.
This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at <B>-O1</B> and higher, except for <B>-Og</B>.
It requires that <B>-ftree-ccp</B> is enabled.
<DT id="878"><B>-ftree-ccp</B><DD>


Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (<FONT SIZE="-1">CCP</FONT>) on trees.  This
pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="879"><B>-fssa-backprop</B><DD>


Propagate information about uses of a value up the definition chain
in order to simplify the definitions.  For example, this pass strips
sign operations if the sign of a value never matters.  The flag is
enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="880"><B>-fssa-phiopt</B><DD>


Perform pattern matching on <FONT SIZE="-1">SSA PHI</FONT> nodes to optimize conditional
code.  This pass is enabled by default at <B>-O1</B> and higher,
except for <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="881"><B>-ftree-switch-conversion</B><DD>


Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by default
at <B>-O2</B> and higher.
<DT id="882"><B>-ftree-tail-merge</B><DD>


Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one with a jump to the
other.  This optimization is known as tail merging or cross jumping.  This flag
is enabled by default at <B>-O2</B> and higher.  The compilation time
in this pass can
be limited using <B>max-tail-merge-comparisons</B> parameter and
<B>max-tail-merge-iterations</B> parameter.
<DT id="883"><B>-ftree-dce</B><DD>


Perform dead code elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">DCE</FONT>) on trees.  This flag is enabled by
default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="884"><B>-ftree-builtin-call-dce</B><DD>


Perform conditional dead code elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">DCE</FONT>) for calls to built-in functions
that may set <TT>&quot;errno&quot;</TT> but are otherwise free of side effects.  This flag is
enabled by default at <B>-O2</B> and higher if <B>-Os</B> is not also
specified.
<DT id="885"><B>-ftree-dominator-opts</B><DD>


Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="886"><B>-ftree-dse</B><DD>


Perform dead store elimination (<FONT SIZE="-1">DSE</FONT>) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location that is later overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This
flag is enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="887"><B>-ftree-ch</B><DD>


Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.  It is not enabled
for <B>-Os</B>, since it usually increases code size.
<DT id="888"><B>-ftree-loop-optimize</B><DD>


Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="889"><B>-ftree-loop-linear</B><DD>



<DT id="890"><B>-floop-strip-mine</B><DD>


<DT id="891"><B>-floop-block</B><DD>



Perform loop nest optimizations.  Same as
<B>-floop-nest-optimize</B>.  To use this code transformation, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> has
to be configured with <B>--with-isl</B> to enable the Graphite loop
transformation infrastructure.
<DT id="892"><B>-fgraphite-identity</B><DD>


Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
<B>-fgraphite-identity</B> we can check the costs or benefits of the
<FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> -&gt; <FONT SIZE="-1">GRAPHITE</FONT> -&gt; <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> transformation.  Some minimal optimizations
are also performed by the code generator isl, like index splitting and
dead code elimination in loops.
<DT id="893"><B>-floop-nest-optimize</B><DD>


Enable the isl based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic loop nest
optimizer based on the Pluto optimization algorithms.  It calculates a loop
structure optimized for data-locality and parallelism.  This option
is experimental.
<DT id="894"><B>-floop-parallelize-all</B><DD>


Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that can
be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can be analyzed to
not contain loop carried dependences without checking that it is
profitable to parallelize the loops.
<DT id="895"><B>-ftree-coalesce-vars</B><DD>


While transforming the program out of the <FONT SIZE="-1">SSA</FONT> representation, attempt to
reduce copying by coalescing versions of different user-defined
variables, instead of just compiler temporaries.  This may severely
limit the ability to debug an optimized program compiled with
<B>-fno-var-tracking-assignments</B>.  In the negated form, this flag
prevents <FONT SIZE="-1">SSA</FONT> coalescing of user variables.  This option is enabled by
default if optimization is enabled, and it does very little otherwise.
<DT id="896"><B>-ftree-loop-if-convert</B><DD>


Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from
the innermost loops in order to improve the ability of the
vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default
if vectorization is enabled.
<DT id="897"><B>-ftree-loop-distribution</B><DD>


Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop


<P>




<PRE>
        DO I = 1, N
          A(I) = B(I) + C
          D(I) = E(I) * F
        ENDDO

</PRE>




<P>


is transformed to


<P>




<PRE>
        DO I = 1, N
           A(I) = B(I) + C
        ENDDO
        DO I = 1, N
           D(I) = E(I) * F
        ENDDO

</PRE>




<P>


This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O3</B>.
It is also enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="898"><B>-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns</B><DD>


Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with
calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O3</B>, and
by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.


<P>


This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to
memset zero.  For example, the loop


<P>




<PRE>
        DO I = 1, N
          A(I) = 0
          B(I) = A(I) + I
        ENDDO

</PRE>




<P>


is transformed to


<P>




<PRE>
        DO I = 1, N
           A(I) = 0
        ENDDO
        DO I = 1, N
           B(I) = A(I) + I
        ENDDO

</PRE>




<P>


and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to memset zero.
This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O3</B>.
It is also enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="899"><B>-floop-interchange</B><DD>


Perform loop interchange outside of graphite.  This flag can improve cache
performance on loop nest and allow further loop optimizations, like
vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop


<P>




<PRE>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
          for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
            for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
              c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];

</PRE>




<P>


is transformed to


<P>




<PRE>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
          for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
              c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];

</PRE>




<P>


This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O3</B>.
It is also enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="900"><B>-floop-unroll-and-jam</B><DD>


Apply unroll and jam transformations on feasible loops.  In a loop
nest this unrolls the outer loop by some factor and fuses the resulting
multiple inner loops.  This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O3</B>.
It is also enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="901"><B>-ftree-loop-im</B><DD>


Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
are hard to handle at <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With <B>-funswitch-loops</B> it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
<DT id="902"><B>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</B><DD>


Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.
<DT id="903"><B>-ftree-scev-cprop</B><DD>


Perform final value replacement.  If a variable is modified in a loop
in such a way that its value when exiting the loop can be determined using
only its initial value and the number of loop iterations, replace uses of
the final value by such a computation, provided it is sufficiently cheap.
This reduces data dependencies and may allow further simplifications.
Enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="904"><B>-fivopts</B><DD>


Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
<DT id="905"><B>-ftree-parallelize-loops=n</B><DD>


Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies <B>-pthread</B>, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for <B>-pthread</B>.
<DT id="906"><B>-ftree-pta</B><DD>


Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at <B>-O1</B> and higher, except for <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="907"><B>-ftree-sra</B><DD>


Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O1</B> and higher,
except for <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="908"><B>-fstore-merging</B><DD>


Perform merging of narrow stores to consecutive memory addresses.  This pass
merges contiguous stores of immediate values narrower than a word into fewer
wider stores to reduce the number of instructions.  This is enabled by default
at <B>-O2</B> and higher as well as <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="909"><B>-ftree-ter</B><DD>


Perform temporary expression replacement during the <FONT SIZE="-1">SSA-</FONT>&gt;normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> generation.  This is
enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and higher.
<DT id="910"><B>-ftree-slsr</B><DD>


Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees.  This recognizes related
expressions involving multiplications and replaces them by less expensive
calculations when possible.  This is enabled by default at <B>-O</B> and
higher.
<DT id="911"><B>-ftree-vectorize</B><DD>


Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables <B>-ftree-loop-vectorize</B>
and <B>-ftree-slp-vectorize</B> if not explicitly specified.
<DT id="912"><B>-ftree-loop-vectorize</B><DD>


Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
<B>-O3</B> and by <B>-ftree-vectorize</B>, <B>-fprofile-use</B>,
and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="913"><B>-ftree-slp-vectorize</B><DD>


Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
<B>-O3</B> and by <B>-ftree-vectorize</B>, <B>-fprofile-use</B>,
and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="914"><B>-fvect-cost-model=</B><I>model</I><DD>


Alter the cost model used for vectorization.  The <I>model</I> argument
should be one of <B>unlimited</B>, <B>dynamic</B> or <B>cheap</B>.
With the <B>unlimited</B> model the vectorized code-path is assumed
to be profitable while with the <B>dynamic</B> model a runtime check
guards the vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration
counts that will likely execute faster than when executing the original
scalar loop.  The <B>cheap</B> model disables vectorization of
loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due to
required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but otherwise
is equal to the <B>dynamic</B> model.
The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is
either <B>dynamic</B> or <B>cheap</B>.
<DT id="915"><B>-fsimd-cost-model=</B><I>model</I><DD>


Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked with the OpenMP
simd directive.  The <I>model</I> argument should be one of
<B>unlimited</B>, <B>dynamic</B>, <B>cheap</B>.  All values of <I>model</I>
have the same meaning as described in <B>-fvect-cost-model</B> and by
default a cost model defined with <B>-fvect-cost-model</B> is used.
<DT id="916"><B>-ftree-vrp</B><DD>


Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at <B>-O2</B> and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if <B>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</B> is
enabled.
<DT id="917"><B>-fsplit-paths</B><DD>


Split paths leading to loop backedges.  This can improve dead code
elimination and common subexpression elimination.  This is enabled by
default at <B>-O3</B> and above.
<DT id="918"><B>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</B><DD>


Enables expression of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.


<P>


A combination of <B>-fweb</B> and <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However, that is not reliable in cases where the loop body
is more complicated than a single basic block.  It also does not work at all
on some architectures due to restrictions in the <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> pass.


<P>


This optimization is enabled by default.
<DT id="919"><B>-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller</B><DD>


With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of some
local variables when unrolling a loop, which can result in superior code.
<DT id="920"><B>-fpartial-inlining</B><DD>


Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the <B>-finline-functions</B>
or <B>-finline-small-functions</B> options.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="921"><B>-fpredictive-commoning</B><DD>


Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing computations
(especially memory loads and stores) performed in previous
iterations of loops.


<P>


This option is enabled at level <B>-O3</B>.
It is also enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="922"><B>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</B><DD>


If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch
memory to improve the performance of loops that access large arrays.


<P>


This option may generate better or worse code; results are highly
dependent on the structure of loops within the source code.


<P>


Disabled at level <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="923"><B>-fno-printf-return-value</B><DD>


Do not substitute constants for known return value of formatted output
functions such as <TT>&quot;sprintf&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;snprintf&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;vsprintf&quot;</TT>, and
<TT>&quot;vsnprintf&quot;</TT> (but not <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> of <TT>&quot;fprintf&quot;</TT>).  This
transformation allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to optimize or even eliminate branches based
on the known return value of these functions called with arguments that
are either constant, or whose values are known to be in a range that
makes determining the exact return value possible.  For example, when
<B>-fprintf-return-value</B> is in effect, both the branch and the
body of the <TT>&quot;if&quot;</TT> statement (but not the call to <TT>&quot;snprint&quot;</TT>)
can be optimized away when <TT>&quot;i&quot;</TT> is a 32-bit or smaller integer
because the return value is guaranteed to be at most 8.


<P>




<PRE>
        char buf[9];
        if (snprintf (buf, &quot;%08x&quot;, i) &gt;= sizeof buf)
          ...

</PRE>




<P>


The <B>-fprintf-return-value</B> option relies on other optimizations
and yields best results with <B>-O2</B> and above.  It works in tandem
with the <B>-Wformat-overflow</B> and <B>-Wformat-truncation</B>
options.  The <B>-fprintf-return-value</B> option is enabled by default.
<DT id="924"><B>-fno-peephole</B><DD>



<DT id="925"><B>-fno-peephole2</B><DD>



Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The difference
between <B>-fno-peephole</B> and <B>-fno-peephole2</B> is in how they
are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use the
other, a few use both.


<P>


<B>-fpeephole</B> is enabled by default.
<B>-fpeephole2</B> enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="926"><B>-fno-guess-branch-probability</B><DD>


Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (<B>-fprofile-arcs</B>).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by <TT>&quot;__builtin_expect&quot;</TT>, then the heuristics are
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the <TT>&quot;__builtin_expect&quot;</TT> info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and <TT>&quot;__builtin_expect&quot;</TT> can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of <TT>&quot;__builtin_expect&quot;</TT> are easier to understand.


<P>


It is also possible to specify expected probability of the expression
with <TT>&quot;__builtin_expect_with_probability&quot;</TT> built-in function.


<P>


The default is <B>-fguess-branch-probability</B> at levels
<B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="927"><B>-freorder-blocks</B><DD>


Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce number of
taken branches and improve code locality.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="928"><B>-freorder-blocks-algorithm=</B><I>algorithm</I><DD>


Use the specified algorithm for basic block reordering.  The
<I>algorithm</I> argument can be <B>simple</B>, which does not increase
code size (except sometimes due to secondary effects like alignment),
or <B>stc</B>, the ``software trace cache'' algorithm, which tries to
put all often executed code together, minimizing the number of branches
executed by making extra copies of code.


<P>


The default is <B>simple</B> at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-Os</B>, and
<B>stc</B> at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>.
<DT id="929"><B>-freorder-blocks-and-partition</B><DD>


In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order
to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks
into separate sections of the assembly and <I>.o</I> files, to improve
paging and cache locality performance.


<P>


This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling or unwind tables (on targets using setjump/longjump or target specific scheme), for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined
section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named
sections.  When <B>-fsplit-stack</B> is used this option is not
enabled by default (to avoid linker errors), but may be enabled
explicitly (if using a working linker).


<P>


Enabled for x86 at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="930"><B>-freorder-functions</B><DD>


Reorder functions in the object file in order to
improve code locality.  This is implemented by using special
subsections <TT>&quot;.text.hot&quot;</TT> for most frequently executed functions and
<TT>&quot;.text.unlikely&quot;</TT> for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.


<P>


This option isn't effective unless you either provide profile feedback
(see <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> for details) or manually annotate functions with 
<TT>&quot;hot&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;cold&quot;</TT> attributes.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="931"><B>-fstrict-aliasing</B><DD>


Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <TT>&quot;unsigned int&quot;</TT> can alias an <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>, but not a
<TT>&quot;void*&quot;</TT> or a <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>.  A character type may alias any other
type.


<P>


Pay special attention to code like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        union a_union {
          int i;
          double d;
        };
        
        int f() {
          union a_union t;
          t.d = 3.0;
          return t.i;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called ``type-punning'') is common.  Even with
<B>-fstrict-aliasing</B>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.    However, this code might not:


<P>




<PRE>
        int f() {
          union a_union t;
          int* ip;
          t.d = 3.0;
          ip = &amp;t.i;
          return *ip;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:


<P>




<PRE>
        int f() {
          double d = 3.0;
          return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


The <B>-fstrict-aliasing</B> option is enabled at levels
<B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="932"><B>-falign-functions</B><DD>

<DT id="936"><B>-falign-functions=</B><I>n</I><B>:</B><I>m</I><B>:</B><I>n2</I><B>:</B><I>m2</I><DD>



Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than
<I>n</I>, skipping up to <I>m</I>-1 bytes.  This ensures that at least
the first <I>m</I> bytes of the function can be fetched by the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>
without crossing an <I>n</I>-byte alignment boundary.


<P>


If <I>m</I> is not specified, it defaults to <I>n</I>.


<P>


Examples: <B>-falign-functions=32</B> aligns functions to the next
32-byte boundary, <B>-falign-functions=24</B> aligns to the next
32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23 bytes or less,
<B>-falign-functions=32:7</B> aligns to the next
32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 6 bytes or less.


<P>


The second pair of <I>n2</I>:<I>m2</I> values allows you to specify
a secondary alignment: <B>-falign-functions=64:7:32:3</B> aligns to
the next 64-byte boundary if this can be done by skipping 6 bytes or less,
otherwise aligns to the next 32-byte boundary if this can be done
by skipping 2 bytes or less.
If <I>m2</I> is not specified, it defaults to <I>n2</I>.


<P>


Some assemblers only support this flag when <I>n</I> is a power of two;
in that case, it is rounded up.


<P>


<B>-fno-align-functions</B> and <B>-falign-functions=1</B> are
equivalent and mean that functions are not aligned.


<P>


If <I>n</I> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.
The maximum allowed <I>n</I> option value is 65536.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>.
<DT id="937"><B>-flimit-function-alignment</B><DD>


If this option is enabled, the compiler tries to avoid unnecessarily
overaligning functions. It attempts to instruct the assembler to align
by the amount specified by <B>-falign-functions</B>, but not to
skip more bytes than the size of the function.
<DT id="938"><B>-falign-labels</B><DD>



<DT id="939"><B>-falign-labels=</B><I>n</I><DD>

<DT id="942"><B>-falign-labels=</B><I>n</I><B>:</B><I>m</I><B>:</B><I>n2</I><B>:</B><I>m2</I><DD>



Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary.


<P>


Parameters of this option are analogous to the <B>-falign-functions</B> option.
<B>-fno-align-labels</B> and <B>-falign-labels=1</B> are
equivalent and mean that labels are not aligned.


<P>


If <B>-falign-loops</B> or <B>-falign-jumps</B> are applicable and
are greater than this value, then their values are used instead.


<P>


If <I>n</I> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default
which is very likely to be <B>1</B>, meaning no alignment.
The maximum allowed <I>n</I> option value is 65536.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>.

Align loops to a power-of-two boundary.  If the loops are executed
many times, this makes up for any execution of the dummy padding
instructions.


<P>


Parameters of this option are analogous to the <B>-falign-functions</B> option.
<B>-fno-align-loops</B> and <B>-falign-loops=1</B> are
equivalent and mean that loops are not aligned.
The maximum allowed <I>n</I> option value is 65536.


<P>


If <I>n</I> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, for branch targets
where the targets can only be reached by jumping.  In this case,
no dummy operations need be executed.


<P>


Parameters of this option are analogous to the <B>-falign-functions</B> option.
<B>-fno-align-jumps</B> and <B>-falign-jumps=1</B> are
equivalent and mean that loops are not aligned.


<P>


If <I>n</I> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.
The maximum allowed <I>n</I> option value is 65536.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>.
<DT id="953"><B>-funit-at-a-time</B><DD>


This option is left for compatibility reasons. <B>-funit-at-a-time</B>
has no effect, while <B>-fno-unit-at-a-time</B> implies
<B>-fno-toplevel-reorder</B> and <B>-fno-section-anchors</B>.


<P>


Enabled by default.
<DT id="954"><B>-fno-toplevel-reorder</B><DD>


Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and <TT>&quot;asm&quot;</TT>
statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear in the
input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static variables
are not removed.  This option is intended to support existing code
that relies on a particular ordering.  For new code, it is better to
use attributes when possible.


<P>


<B>-ftoplevel-reorder</B> is the default at <B>-O1</B> and higher, and
also at <B>-O0</B> if <B>-fsection-anchors</B> is explicitly requested.
Additionally <B>-fno-toplevel-reorder</B> implies
<B>-fno-section-anchors</B>.
<DT id="955"><B>-fweb</B><DD>


Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE,</FONT> loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in a
``home register''.


<P>


Enabled by default with <B>-funroll-loops</B>.
<DT id="956"><B>-fwhole-program</B><DD>


Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>
and those merged by attribute <TT>&quot;externally_visible&quot;</TT> become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers.


<P>


This option should not be used in combination with <B>-flto</B>.
Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.
<DT id="957"><B>-flto[=</B><I>n</I><B>]</B><DD>


This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> (one of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s internal
representations) and writes it to special <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.


<P>


To use the link-time optimizer, <B>-flto</B> and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.
It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time.  
For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
        gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
        gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o

</PRE>




<P>


The first two invocations to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> save a bytecode representation
of <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> into special <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> sections inside <I>foo.o</I> and
<I>bar.o</I>.  The final invocation reads the <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> bytecode from
<I>foo.o</I> and <I>bar.o</I>, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
<I>foo.o</I> and <I>bar.o</I> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
<I>bar.o</I> into functions in <I>foo.o</I> and vice-versa.


<P>


Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c

</PRE>




<P>


The above generates bytecode for <I>foo.c</I> and <I>bar.c</I>,
merges them together into a single <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce <I>myprog</I>.


<P>


The important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver to perform the link step.
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the <B>-flto</B> command-line option.  
You can always override
the automatic decision to do link-time optimization
by passing <B>-fno-lto</B> to the link command.


<P>


To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see <B>-fuse-linker-plugin</B>) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, <B>-fwhole-program</B> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.


<P>


When a file is compiled with <B>-flto</B> without
<B>-fuse-linker-plugin</B>, the generated object file is larger than
a regular object file because it contains <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> bytecodes and the usual
final code (see <B>-ffat-lto-objects</B>.  This means that
object files with <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> information can be linked as normal object
files; if <B>-fno-lto</B> is passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
<B>-fno-fat-lto-objects</B> is enabled the compile stage is faster
but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.


<P>


When producing the final binary, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
<FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> bytecodes and final object code.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> automatically selects
which files to optimize in <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> mode and which files to link without
further processing.


<P>


Generally, options specified at link time override those
specified at compile time, although in some cases <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> attempts to infer
link-time options from the settings used to compile the input files.


<P>


If you do not specify an optimization level option <B>-O</B> at
link time, then <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses the highest optimization level 
used when compiling the object files.  Note that it is generally 
ineffective to specify an optimization level option only at link time and 
not at compile time, for two reasons.  First, compiling without 
optimization suppresses compiler passes that gather information 
needed for effective optimization at link time.  Second, some early
optimization passes can be performed only at compile time and 
not at link time.


<P>


There are some code generation flags preserved by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link.
Currently, the following options and their settings are taken from
the first object file that explicitly specifies them: 
<B>-fPIC</B>, <B>-fpic</B>, <B>-fpie</B>, <B>-fcommon</B>,
<B>-fexceptions</B>, <B>-fnon-call-exceptions</B>, <B>-fgnu-tm</B>
and all the <B>-m</B> target flags.


<P>


Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all compilation units,
and trying to override this at link time with a conflicting value
is ignored.  This includes options such as <B>-freg-struct-return</B>
and <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>.


<P>


Other options such as <B>-ffp-contract</B>, <B>-fno-strict-overflow</B>,
<B>-fwrapv</B>, <B>-fno-trapv</B> or <B>-fno-strict-aliasing</B>
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
<B>-fno-strict-overflow</B>, <B>-fwrapv</B> and <B>-fno-trapv</B> take
precedence; and for example <B>-ffp-contract=off</B> takes precedence
over <B>-ffp-contract=fast</B>.  You can override them at link time.


<P>


To enable debug info generation you need to supply <B>-g</B> at
compile-time.  If any of the input files at link time were built
with debug info generation enabled the link will enable debug info
generation as well.  Any elaborate debug info settings
like the dwarf level <B>-gdwarf-5</B> need to be explicitely repeated
at the linker command line and mixing different settings in different
translation units is discouraged.


<P>


If <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99 6.2.7</FONT>), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.


<P>


Another feature of <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -c -flto foo.c
        g++ -c -flto bar.cc
        gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
        g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran

</PRE>




<P>


Notice that the final link is done with <B>g++</B> to get the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
runtime libraries and <B>-lgfortran</B> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.


<P>


If object files containing <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
<I>libfoo.a</I>, it is possible to extract and use them in an <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To create static libraries suitable
for <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO,</FONT> use <B>gcc-ar</B> and <B>gcc-ranlib</B> instead of <B>ar</B>
and <B>ranlib</B>; 
to show the symbols of object files with <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> bytecode, use
<B>gcc-nm</B>.  Those commands require that <B>ar</B>, <B>ranlib</B>
and <B>nm</B> have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the
flag <B>-fuse-linker-plugin</B> to ensure that the library participates in
the <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> optimization process:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo

</PRE>




<P>


With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
<FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> files from <I>libfoo.a</I> and passes them on to the running <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
to make them part of the aggregated <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> image to be optimized.


<P>


If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <I>libfoo.a</I>
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable
for both <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
<B>-flto</B> <B>-ffat-lto-objects</B>.


<P>


Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <B>-flto</B> and <B>-fwhole-program</B> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of <B>-fwhole-program</B> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see <B>-fuse-linker-plugin</B>).


<P>


The current implementation of <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> do not work with an older or newer version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>


<P>


Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information on systems other than those using a combination of <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> and
<FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF.</FONT>


<P>


If you specify the optional <I>n</I>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <I>n</I>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <B>make</B> program.  The
environment variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MAKE</B></FONT><B></B> may be used to override the program
used.


<P>


You can also specify <B>-flto=jobserver</B> to use <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a <B>+</B> to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MAKE</B></FONT><B></B> is
<FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> make.


<P>


Use <B>-flto=auto</B> to use <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> make's job server, if available,
or otherwise fall back to autodetection of the number of <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> threads
present in your system.
<DT id="958"><B>-flto-partition=</B><I>alg</I><DD>


Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer.
The value is either <B>1to1</B> to specify a partitioning mirroring
the original source files or <B>balanced</B> to specify partitioning
into equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or <B>max</B> to create
new partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying <B>none</B>
as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely. 
The default value is <B>balanced</B>. While <B>1to1</B> can be used
as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the <B>max</B>
partitioning is intended for internal testing only.
The value <B>one</B> specifies that exactly one partition should be
used while the value <B>none</B> bypasses partitioning and executes
the link-time optimization step directly from the <FONT SIZE="-1">WPA</FONT> phase.
<DT id="959"><B>-flto-odr-type-merging</B><DD>


Enable streaming of mangled types names of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> types and their unification
at link time.  This increases size of <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> object files, but enables
diagnostics about One Definition Rule violations.
<DT id="960"><B>-flto-compression-level=</B><I>n</I><DD>


This option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate
language written to <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> object files, and is only meaningful in
conjunction with <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> mode (<B>-flto</B>).  Valid
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).  Values
outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not
given, a default balanced compression setting is used.
<DT id="961"><B>-fuse-linker-plugin</B><DD>


Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This
option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is available in gold
or in <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> ld 2.21 or newer.


<P>


This option enables the extraction of object files with <FONT SIZE="-1">GIMPLE</FONT> bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared
libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to <B>-fwhole-program</B>.
See <B>-flto</B> for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.


<P>


This option is enabled by default when <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> support in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is enabled
and <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was configured for use with
a linker supporting plugins (<FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> ld 2.21 or newer or gold).
<DT id="962"><B>-ffat-lto-objects</B><DD>


Fat <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language
and the object code. This makes them usable for both <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> linking and normal
linking. This option is effective only when compiling with <B>-flto</B>
and is ignored at link time.


<P>


<B>-fno-fat-lto-objects</B> improves compilation time over plain <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO,</FONT> but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO.</FONT> It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
<B>nm</B>, <B>ar</B> and <B>ranlib</B>
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> provides the <B>gcc-ar</B>,
<B>gcc-nm</B>, <B>gcc-ranlib</B> wrappers to pass the right options
to these tools. With non fat <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> makefiles need to be modified to use them.


<P>


Note that modern binutils provide plugin auto-load mechanism.
Installing the linker plugin into <I></I>$libdir<I>/bfd-plugins</I> has the same
effect as usage of the command wrappers (<B>gcc-ar</B>, <B>gcc-nm</B> and
<B>gcc-ranlib</B>).


<P>


The default is <B>-fno-fat-lto-objects</B> on targets with linker plugin
support.
<DT id="963"><B>-fcompare-elim</B><DD>


After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction splitting,
identify arithmetic instructions that compute processor flags similar to a
comparison operation based on that arithmetic.  If possible, eliminate the
explicit comparison operation.


<P>


This pass only applies to certain targets that cannot explicitly represent
the comparison operation before register allocation is complete.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="964"><B>-fcprop-registers</B><DD>


After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction splitting,
perform a copy-propagation pass to try to reduce scheduling dependencies
and occasionally eliminate the copy.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O</B>, <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="965"><B>-fprofile-correction</B><DD>


Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may
be inconsistent due to missed counter updates. When this option is specified,
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By
default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> emits an error message when an inconsistent profile is detected.


<P>


This option is enabled by <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="966"><B>-fprofile-use</B><DD>



<DT id="967"><B>-fprofile-use=</B><I>path</I><DD>



Enable profile feedback-directed optimizations, 
and the following optimizations, many of which
are generally profitable only with profile feedback available:


<P>


<B>-fbranch-probabilities  -fprofile-values 
-funroll-loops  -fpeel-loops  -ftracer  -fvpt 
-finline-functions  -fipa-cp  -fipa-cp-clone  -fipa-bit-cp

-fgcse-after-reload  -ftree-loop-vectorize  -ftree-slp-vectorize 
-fvect-cost-model=dynamic  -ftree-loop-distribute-patterns 
-fprofile-reorder-functions</B>


<P>


Before you can use this option, you must first generate profiling information.


<P>


By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not
match the source code.  This error can be turned into a warning by using
<B>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</B>.  Note this may result in poorly
optimized code.  Additionally, by default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> also emits a warning message if
the feedback profiles do not exist (see <B>-Wmissing-profile</B>).


<P>


If <I>path</I> is specified, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> looks at the <I>path</I> to find
the profile feedback data files. See <B>-fprofile-dir</B>.
<DT id="968"><B>-fauto-profile</B><DD>



<DT id="969"><B>-fauto-profile=</B><I>path</I><DD>



Enable sampling-based feedback-directed optimizations, 
and the following optimizations,
many of which are generally profitable only with profile feedback available:


<P>


<B>-fbranch-probabilities  -fprofile-values 
-funroll-loops  -fpeel-loops  -ftracer  -fvpt 
-finline-functions  -fipa-cp  -fipa-cp-clone  -fipa-bit-cp

-fgcse-after-reload  -ftree-loop-vectorize  -ftree-slp-vectorize 
-fvect-cost-model=dynamic  -ftree-loop-distribute-patterns 
-fprofile-correction</B>


<P>


<I>path</I> is the name of a file containing AutoFDO profile information.
If omitted, it defaults to <I>fbdata.afdo</I> in the current directory.


<P>


Producing an AutoFDO profile data file requires running your program
with the <B>perf</B> utility on a supported GNU/Linux target system.
For more information, see &lt;<B><A HREF="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/">https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/</A></B>&gt;.

E.g.


<P>




<PRE>
        perf record -e br_inst_retired:near_taken -b -o perf.data \
            -- your_program

</PRE>




<P>


Then use the <B>create_gcov</B> tool to convert the raw profile data
to a format that can be used by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  You must also supply the 
unstripped binary for your program to this tool.  
See &lt;<B><A HREF="https://github.com/google/autofdo">https://github.com/google/autofdo</A></B>&gt;.

</DL>
<P>

The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point 
arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="970"><B>-ffloat-store</B><DD>


Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating-point value is taken from a
register or memory.


<P>


This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> floating
point.  Use <B>-ffloat-store</B> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
<DT id="971"><B>-fexcess-precision=</B><I>style</I><DD>


This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point operations occur in a format with more precision or
range than the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> standard and interchange floating-point types.  By
default, <B>-fexcess-precision=fast</B> is in effect; this means that
operations may be carried out in a wider precision than the types specified
in the source if that would result in faster code, and it is unpredictable
when rounding to the types specified in the source code takes place.
When compiling C, if <B>-fexcess-precision=standard</B> is specified then
excess precision follows the rules specified in <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99</FONT>; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas <B>-ffloat-store</B> only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as <B>-std=c99</B> is used.
<B>-ffast-math</B> enables <B>-fexcess-precision=fast</B> by default
regardless of whether a strict conformance option is used.


<P>


<B>-fexcess-precision=standard</B> is not implemented for languages
other than C.  On the x86, it has no effect if <B>-mfpmath=sse</B>
or <B>-mfpmath=sse+387</B> is specified; in the former case, <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT>
semantics apply without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding
is unpredictable.
<DT id="972"><B>-ffast-math</B><DD>


Sets the options <B>-fno-math-errno</B>, <B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B>,
<B>-ffinite-math-only</B>, <B>-fno-rounding-math</B>,
<B>-fno-signaling-nans</B>, <B>-fcx-limited-range</B> and
<B>-fexcess-precision=fast</B>.


<P>


This option causes the preprocessor macro <TT>&quot;__FAST_MATH__&quot;</TT> to be defined.


<P>


This option is not turned on by any <B>-O</B> option besides
<B>-Ofast</B> since it can result in incorrect output for programs
that depend on an exact implementation of <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
<DT id="973"><B>-fno-math-errno</B><DD>


Do not set <TT>&quot;errno&quot;</TT> after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., <TT>&quot;sqrt&quot;</TT>.  A program that relies on
<FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> arithmetic compatibility.


<P>


This option is not turned on by any <B>-O</B> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.


<P>


The default is <B>-fmath-errno</B>.


<P>


On Darwin systems, the math library never sets <TT>&quot;errno&quot;</TT>.  There is
therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that
it might, and <B>-fno-math-errno</B> is the default.
<DT id="974"><B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B><DD>


Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> or
<FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT> standards.  When used at link time, it may include libraries
or startup files that change the default <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> control word or other
similar optimizations.


<P>


This option is not turned on by any <B>-O</B> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
Enables <B>-fno-signed-zeros</B>, <B>-fno-trapping-math</B>,
<B>-fassociative-math</B> and <B>-freciprocal-math</B>.


<P>


The default is <B>-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations</B>.
<DT id="975"><B>-fassociative-math</B><DD>


Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  <FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
<TT>&quot;(x + 2**52) - 2**52&quot;</TT>.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both <B>-fno-signed-zeros</B> and
<B>-fno-trapping-math</B> be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with <B>-frounding-math</B>. For Fortran the option
is automatically enabled when both <B>-fno-signed-zeros</B> and
<B>-fno-trapping-math</B> are in effect.


<P>


The default is <B>-fno-associative-math</B>.
<DT id="976"><B>-freciprocal-math</B><DD>


Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example <TT>&quot;x / y&quot;</TT>
can be replaced with <TT>&quot;x * (1/y)&quot;</TT>, which is useful if <TT>&quot;(1/y)&quot;</TT>
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.


<P>


The default is <B>-fno-reciprocal-math</B>.
<DT id="977"><B>-ffinite-math-only</B><DD>


Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
that arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.


<P>


This option is not turned on by any <B>-O</B> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.


<P>


The default is <B>-fno-finite-math-only</B>.
<DT id="978"><B>-fno-signed-zeros</B><DD>


Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with <B>-ffinite-math-only</B>).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.


<P>


The default is <B>-fsigned-zeros</B>.
<DT id="979"><B>-fno-trapping-math</B><DD>


Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires
that <B>-fno-signaling-nans</B> be in effect.  Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on ``non-stop'' <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> arithmetic, for example.


<P>


This option should never be turned on by any <B>-O</B> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> rules/specifications for
math functions.


<P>


The default is <B>-ftrapping-math</B>.
<DT id="980"><B>-frounding-math</B><DD>


Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating-point
rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating-point expressions at compile time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.


<P>


The default is <B>-fno-rounding-math</B>.


<P>


This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may provide finer control of this setting
using C99's <TT>&quot;FENV_ACCESS&quot;</TT> pragma.  This command-line option
will be used to specify the default state for <TT>&quot;FENV_ACCESS&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="981"><B>-fsignaling-nans</B><DD>


Compile code assuming that <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> signaling NaNs may generate user-visible
traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this option disables
optimizations that may change the number of exceptions visible with
signaling NaNs.  This option implies <B>-ftrapping-math</B>.


<P>


This option causes the preprocessor macro <TT>&quot;__SUPPORT_SNAN__&quot;</TT> to
be defined.


<P>


The default is <B>-fno-signaling-nans</B>.


<P>


This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> optimizations that affect signaling NaN behavior.
<DT id="982"><B>-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact</B><DD>


Do not allow the built-in functions <TT>&quot;ceil&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;floor&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;round&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;trunc&quot;</TT>, and their <TT>&quot;float&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;long
double&quot;</TT> variants, to generate code that raises the ``inexact''
floating-point exception for noninteger arguments.  <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99</FONT> and C11
allow these functions to raise the ``inexact'' exception, but <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO/IEC
TS 18661-1:2014,</FONT> the C bindings to <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE 754-2008,</FONT> does not allow these
functions to do so.


<P>


The default is <B>-ffp-int-builtin-inexact</B>, allowing the
exception to be raised.  This option does nothing unless
<B>-ftrapping-math</B> is in effect.


<P>


Even if <B>-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact</B> is used, if the functions
generate a call to a library function then the ``inexact'' exception
may be raised if the library implementation does not follow <FONT SIZE="-1">TS 18661.</FONT>
<DT id="983"><B>-fsingle-precision-constant</B><DD>


Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead of
implicitly converting them to double-precision constants.
<DT id="984"><B>-fcx-limited-range</B><DD>


When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
needed when performing complex division.  Also, there is no checking
whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is <TT>&quot;NaN
+ I*NaN&quot;</TT>, with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.  The
default is <B>-fno-cx-limited-range</B>, but is enabled by
<B>-ffast-math</B>.


<P>


This option controls the default setting of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C99</FONT>
<TT>&quot;CX_LIMITED_RANGE&quot;</TT> pragma.  Nevertheless, the option applies to
all languages.
<DT id="985"><B>-fcx-fortran-rules</B><DD>


Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.  Range
reduction is done as part of complex division, but there is no checking
whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is <TT>&quot;NaN
+ I*NaN&quot;</TT>, with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.


<P>


The default is <B>-fno-cx-fortran-rules</B>.
</DL>
<P>

The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any <B>-O</B> options.  This
section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="986"><B>-fbranch-probabilities</B><DD>


After running a program compiled with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>,
you can compile it a second time using
<B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When a program
compiled with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> exits, it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <I>sourcename.gcda</I> for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.


<P>


With <B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> puts a
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>REG_BR_PROB</B></FONT><B></B> note on each <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>JUMP_INSN</B></FONT><B></B> and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CALL_INSN</B></FONT><B></B>.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <I>reorg.c</I>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is most likely to take, the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>REG_BR_PROB</B></FONT><B></B> values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.


<P>


Enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="987"><B>-fprofile-values</B><DD>


If combined with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.


<P>


With <B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>, it reads back the data gathered
from profiling values of expressions for usage in optimizations.


<P>


Enabled by <B>-fprofile-generate</B>, <B>-fprofile-use</B>, and
<B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="988"><B>-fprofile-reorder-functions</B><DD>


Function reordering based on profile instrumentation collects
first time of execution of a function and orders these functions
in ascending order.


<P>


Enabled with <B>-fprofile-use</B>.
<DT id="989"><B>-fvpt</B><DD>


If combined with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, this option instructs the compiler
to add code to gather information about values of expressions.


<P>


With <B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>, it reads back the data gathered
and actually performs the optimizations based on them.
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operations
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.


<P>


Enabled with <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="990"><B>-frename-registers</B><DD>


Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
most benefits processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in
a ``home register''.


<P>


Enabled by default with <B>-funroll-loops</B>.
<DT id="991"><B>-fschedule-fusion</B><DD>


Performs a target dependent pass over the instruction stream to schedule
instructions of same type together because target machine can execute them
more efficiently if they are adjacent to each other in the instruction flow.


<P>


Enabled at levels <B>-O2</B>, <B>-O3</B>, <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="992"><B>-ftracer</B><DD>


Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
a better job.


<P>


Enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="993"><B>-funroll-loops</B><DD>


Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  <B>-funroll-loops</B> implies
<B>-frerun-cse-after-loop</B>, <B>-fweb</B> and <B>-frename-registers</B>.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
a small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.


<P>


Enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="994"><B>-funroll-all-loops</B><DD>


Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
<B>-funroll-all-loops</B> implies the same options as
<B>-funroll-loops</B>.
<DT id="995"><B>-fpeel-loops</B><DD>


Peels loops for which there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback or static analysis).  It also turns on
complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant
number of iterations).


<P>


Enabled by <B>-O3</B>, <B>-fprofile-use</B>, and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="996"><B>-fmove-loop-invariants</B><DD>


Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> loop optimizer.  Enabled
at level <B>-O1</B> and higher, except for <B>-Og</B>.
<DT id="997"><B>-fsplit-loops</B><DD>


Split a loop into two if it contains a condition that's always true
for one side of the iteration space and false for the other.


<P>


Enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="998"><B>-funswitch-loops</B><DD>


Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with duplicates
of the loop on both branches (modified according to result of the condition).


<P>


Enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="999"><B>-fversion-loops-for-strides</B><DD>


If a loop iterates over an array with a variable stride, create another
version of the loop that assumes the stride is always one.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
          x[i * stride] = ...;

</PRE>




<P>


becomes:


<P>




<PRE>
        if (stride == 1)
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
            x[i] = ...;
        else
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
            x[i * stride] = ...;

</PRE>




<P>


This is particularly useful for assumed-shape arrays in Fortran where
(for example) it allows better vectorization assuming contiguous accesses.
This flag is enabled by default at <B>-O3</B>.
It is also enabled by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fauto-profile</B>.
<DT id="1000"><B>-ffunction-sections</B><DD>



<DT id="1001"><B>-fdata-sections</B><DD>



Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.


<P>


Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to
improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> object format have linkers with such optimizations.  On <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX,</FONT> the linker
rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on the call graph.  The performance impact
varies.


<P>


Together with a linker garbage collection (linker <B>--gc-sections</B>
option) these options may lead to smaller statically-linked executables (after
stripping).


<P>


On <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF/DWARF</FONT> systems these options do not degenerate the quality of the debug
information.  There could be issues with other object files/debug info formats.


<P>


Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.  When
you specify these options, the assembler and linker create larger object and
executable files and are also slower.  These options affect code generation.
They prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using relative
locations inside a translation unit since the locations are unknown until
link time.  An example of such an optimization is relaxing calls to short call
instructions.
<DT id="1002"><B>-fbranch-target-load-optimize</B><DD>


Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading.
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.
<DT id="1003"><B>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2</B><DD>


Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue / epilogue
threading.
<DT id="1004"><B>-fbtr-bb-exclusive</B><DD>


When performing branch target register load optimization, don't reuse
branch target registers within any basic block.
<DT id="1005"><B>-fstdarg-opt</B><DD>


Optimize the prologue of variadic argument functions with respect to usage of
those arguments.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> In Ubuntu 14.10 and later versions,
<B>-fstack-protector-strong</B> is enabled by default for C,
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, ObjC, ObjC++, if none of <B>-fno-stack-protector</B>,
<B>-nostdlib</B>, nor <B>-ffreestanding</B> are found.
<DT id="1006"><B>-fsection-anchors</B><DD>


Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared ``anchor'' symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries and <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> accesses on some
targets.


<P>


For example, the implementation of the following function <TT>&quot;foo&quot;</TT>:


<P>




<PRE>
        static int a, b, c;
        int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }

</PRE>




<P>


usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <B>-fsection-anchors</B>, it accesses the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):


<P>




<PRE>
        int foo (void)
        {
          register int *xr = &amp;x;
          return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];
        }

</PRE>




<P>


Not all targets support this option.
<DT id="1007"><B>--param</B> <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>value</I><DD>


In some places, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not inline functions
that contain more than a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command line using the
<B>--param</B> option.


<P>


The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.


<P>


In order to get minimal, maximal and default value of a parameter,
one can use <B>--help=param -Q</B> options.


<P>


In each case, the <I>value</I> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<I>name</I> are:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1008"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1009"><B>predictable-branch-outcome</B><DD>


When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than this threshold
(in percent), then it is considered well predictable.
<DT id="1010"><B>max-rtl-if-conversion-insns</B><DD>


<FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> if-conversion tries to remove conditional branches around a block and
replace them with conditionally executed instructions.  This parameter
gives the maximum number of instructions in a block which should be
considered for if-conversion.  The compiler will
also use other heuristics to decide whether if-conversion is likely to be
profitable.
<DT id="1011"><B>max-rtl-if-conversion-predictable-cost</B><DD>



<DT id="1012"><B>max-rtl-if-conversion-unpredictable-cost</B><DD>



<FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> if-conversion will try to remove conditional branches around a block
and replace them with conditionally executed instructions.  These parameters
give the maximum permissible cost for the sequence that would be generated
by if-conversion depending on whether the branch is statically determined
to be predictable or not.  The units for this parameter are the same as
those for the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> internal seq_cost metric.  The compiler will try to
provide a reasonable default for this parameter using the <FONT SIZE="-1">BRANCH_COST</FONT>
target macro.
<DT id="1013"><B>max-crossjump-edges</B><DD>


The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping.
The algorithm used by <B>-fcrossjumping</B> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
<DT id="1014"><B>min-crossjump-insns</B><DD>


The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end
of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
cross-jumped from are matched.
<DT id="1015"><B>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</B><DD>


The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
<DT id="1016"><B>max-goto-duplication-insns</B><DD>


The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.
<DT id="1017"><B>max-delay-slot-insn-search</B><DD>


The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions are searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
are minimal, so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.
<DT id="1018"><B>max-delay-slot-live-search</B><DD>


When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
<DT id="1019"><B>max-gcse-memory</B><DD>


The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization is not done.
<DT id="1020"><B>max-gcse-insertion-ratio</B><DD>


If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value
for any expression, then <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL PRE</FONT> inserts or removes the expression and thus
leaves partially redundant computations in the instruction stream.
<DT id="1021"><B>max-pending-list-length</B><DD>


The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling allows
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.
<DT id="1022"><B>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts</B><DD>


The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make
when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can exponentially increase
compilation time.
<DT id="1023"><B>max-inline-insns-single</B><DD>


Several parameters control the tree inliner used in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
considers for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>).
<DT id="1024"><B>max-inline-insns-auto</B><DD>


When you use <B>-finline-functions</B> (included in <B>-O3</B>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
<DT id="1025"><B>max-inline-insns-small</B><DD>


This is bound applied to calls which are considered relevant with
<B>-finline-small-functions</B>.
<DT id="1026"><B>max-inline-insns-size</B><DD>


This is bound applied to calls which are optimized for size. Small growth
may be desirable to anticipate optimization oppurtunities exposed by inlining.
<DT id="1027"><B>uninlined-function-insns</B><DD>


Number of instructions accounted by inliner for function overhead such as
function prologue and epilogue.
<DT id="1028"><B>uninlined-function-time</B><DD>


Extra time accounted by inliner for function overhead such as time needed to
execute function prologue and epilogue
<DT id="1029"><B>uninlined-thunk-insns</B><DD>



<DT id="1030"><B>uninlined-thunk-time</B><DD>



Same as <B>--param uninlined-function-insns</B> and
<B>--param uninlined-function-time</B> but applied to function thunks
<DT id="1031"><B>inline-min-speedup</B><DD>


When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee runtime exceeds this
threshold (in percent), the function can be inlined regardless of the limit on
<B>--param max-inline-insns-single</B> and <B>--param
max-inline-insns-auto</B>.
<DT id="1032"><B>large-function-insns</B><DD>


The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
<B>--param large-function-growth</B>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
back end.
<DT id="1033"><B>large-function-growth</B><DD>


Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
For example, parameter value 100 limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
<DT id="1034"><B>large-unit-insns</B><DD>


The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by <B>--param inline-unit-growth</B>.
For small units this might be too tight.
For example, consider a unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <B>--param large-unit-insns</B>
before applying <B>--param inline-unit-growth</B>.
<DT id="1035"><B>inline-unit-growth</B><DD>


Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
For example, parameter value 20 limits unit growth to 1.2 times the original
size. Cold functions (either marked cold via an attribute or by profile
feedback) are not accounted into the unit size.
<DT id="1036"><B>ipcp-unit-growth</B><DD>


Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by
interprocedural constant propagation.  For example, parameter value 10 limits
unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.
<DT id="1037"><B>large-stack-frame</B><DD>


The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.
<DT id="1038"><B>large-stack-frame-growth</B><DD>


Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents.
For example, parameter value 1000 limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.
<DT id="1039"><B>max-inline-insns-recursive</B><DD>



<DT id="1040"><B>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</B><DD>



Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line copy of a
self-recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.


<P>


<B>--param max-inline-insns-recursive</B> applies to functions
declared inline.
For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <B>-finline-functions</B> (included in <B>-O3</B>) is
enabled; <B>--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</B> applies instead.
<DT id="1041"><B>max-inline-recursive-depth</B><DD>



<DT id="1042"><B>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</B><DD>



Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive inlining.


<P>


<B>--param max-inline-recursive-depth</B> applies to functions
declared inline.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <B>-finline-functions</B> (included in <B>-O3</B>) is
enabled; <B>--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</B> applies instead.
<DT id="1043"><B>min-inline-recursive-probability</B><DD>


Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.


<P>


When profile feedback is available (see <B>-fprofile-generate</B>) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from the probability that function recurses
via a given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call
expressions whose probability exceeds the given threshold (in percents).
<DT id="1044"><B>early-inlining-insns</B><DD>


Specify growth that the early inliner can make.  In effect it increases
the amount of inlining for code having a large abstraction penalty.
<DT id="1045"><B>max-early-inliner-iterations</B><DD>


Limit of iterations of the early inliner.  This basically bounds
the number of nested indirect calls the early inliner can resolve.
Deeper chains are still handled by late inlining.
<DT id="1046"><B>comdat-sharing-probability</B><DD>


Probability (in percent) that C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> inline function with comdat visibility
are shared across multiple compilation units.
<DT id="1047"><B>profile-func-internal-id</B><DD>


A parameter to control whether to use function internal id in profile
database lookup. If the value is 0, the compiler uses an id that
is based on function assembler name and filename, which makes old profile
data more tolerant to source changes such as function reordering etc.
<DT id="1048"><B>min-vect-loop-bound</B><DD>


The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not vectorized
when <B>-ftree-vectorize</B> is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option
to allow vectorization.
<DT id="1049"><B>gcse-cost-distance-ratio</B><DD>


Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCSE</FONT> optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
is with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than <B>gcse-unrestricted-cost</B>.  Specifying 0 disables
hoisting of simple expressions.
<DT id="1050"><B>gcse-unrestricted-cost</B><DD>


Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which <FONT SIZE="-1">GCSE</FONT> optimizations do not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,
the more aggressive code hoisting is.  Specifying 0 
allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.
<DT id="1051"><B>max-hoist-depth</B><DD>


The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist.
This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting algorithm.
The value of 0 does not limit on the search, but may slow down compilation
of huge functions.
<DT id="1052"><B>max-tail-merge-comparisons</B><DD>


The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with.  This is used to
avoid quadratic behavior in tree tail merging.
<DT id="1053"><B>max-tail-merge-iterations</B><DD>


The maximum amount of iterations of the pass over the function.  This is used to

merging pass.
<DT id="1056"><B>max-unrolled-insns</B><DD>


The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be unrolled.
If a loop is unrolled, this parameter also determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.
<DT id="1057"><B>max-average-unrolled-insns</B><DD>


The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop may have to be unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled,
this parameter also determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.
<DT id="1059"><B>max-peeled-insns</B><DD>

The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.
<DT id="1067"><B>lim-expensive</B><DD>


The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.
<DT id="1068"><B>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</B><DD>


Bound on number of candidates for induction variables, below which
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  If there are more candidates than this,
only the most relevant ones are considered to avoid quadratic time complexity.
<DT id="1069"><B>iv-max-considered-uses</B><DD>


The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.
<DT id="1070"><B>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</B><DD>


If the number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set
when adding a new one.
<DT id="1071"><B>avg-loop-niter</B><DD>


Average number of iterations of a loop.
<DT id="1072"><B>dse-max-object-size</B><DD>


Maximum size (in bytes) of objects tracked bytewise by dead store elimination.
Larger values may result in larger compilation times.
<DT id="1073"><B>dse-max-alias-queries-per-store</B><DD>


Maximum number of queries into the alias oracle per store.
Larger values result in larger compilation times and may result in more
removed dead stores.
<DT id="1074"><B>scev-max-expr-size</B><DD>


Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer.
Large expressions slow the analyzer.
<DT id="1075"><B>scev-max-expr-complexity</B><DD>


Bound on the complexity of the expressions in the scalar evolutions analyzer.
Complex expressions slow the analyzer.
<DT id="1076"><B>max-tree-if-conversion-phi-args</B><DD>


Maximum number of arguments in a <FONT SIZE="-1">PHI</FONT> supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">TREE</FONT> if conversion
unless the loop is marked with simd pragma.

for analysis of the number of iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.
<DT id="1081"><B>hot-bb-count-ws-permille</B><DD>


A basic block profile count is considered hot if it contributes to 
the given permillage (i.e. 0...1000) of the entire profiled execution.
<DT id="1082"><B>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</B><DD>


Select fraction of the entry block frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.
<DT id="1083"><B>max-predicted-iterations</B><DD>


The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and
another loop with unknown bound.
The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds appears artificially cold relative to the other one.
<DT id="1084"><B>builtin-expect-probability</B><DD>


Control the probability of the expression having the specified value. This
parameter takes a percentage (i.e. 0 ... 100) as input.

The maximum length of a constant string for a builtin string cmp call 
eligible for inlining.

a function to align the basic block.
<DT id="1087"><B>align-loop-iterations</B><DD>


A loop expected to iterate at least the selected number of iterations is
aligned.
<DT id="1088"><B>tracer-dynamic-coverage</B><DD>



<DT id="1089"><B>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</B><DD>



This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.


<P>


The <B>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</B> parameter
is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.
<DT id="1090"><B>tracer-max-code-growth</B><DD>


Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
a rather artificial limit, as most of the duplicates are eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.
<DT id="1091"><B>tracer-min-branch-ratio</B><DD>


Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).
<DT id="1092"><B>tracer-min-branch-probability</B><DD>



<DT id="1093"><B>tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</B><DD>



Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower than this
threshold.


<P>


Similarly to <B>tracer-dynamic-coverage</B> two parameters are
provided.  <B>tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</B> is used for
compilation with profile feedback and <B>tracer-min-branch-probability</B>
compilation without.  The value for compilation with profile feedback
needs to be more conservative (higher) in order to make tracer
effective.
<DT id="1094"><B>stack-clash-protection-guard-size</B><DD>


Specify the size of the operating system provided stack guard as
2 raised to <I>num</I> bytes.  Higher values may reduce the
number of explicit probes, but a value larger than the operating system
provided guard will leave code vulnerable to stack clash style attacks.
<DT id="1095"><B>stack-clash-protection-probe-interval</B><DD>


Stack clash protection involves probing stack space as it is allocated.  This
param controls the maximum distance between probes into the stack as 2 raised
to <I>num</I> bytes.  Higher values may reduce the number of explicit probes, but a value
larger than the operating system provided guard will leave code vulnerable to
stack clash style attacks.
<DT id="1096"><B>max-cse-path-length</B><DD>


The maximum number of basic blocks on path that <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> considers.
<DT id="1097"><B>max-cse-insns</B><DD>


The maximum number of instructions <FONT SIZE="-1">CSE</FONT> processes before flushing.
<DT id="1098"><B>ggc-min-expand</B><DD>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.


<P>


The default is 30% + 70% * (<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM/1GB</FONT>) with an upper bound of 100% when
<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> &gt;= 1GB.  If <TT>&quot;getrlimit&quot;</TT> is available, the notion of ``<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM''</FONT> is
the smallest of actual <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> and <TT>&quot;RLIMIT_DATA&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;RLIMIT_AS&quot;</TT>.  If
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is not able to calculate <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<B>ggc-min-heapsize</B> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
<DT id="1099"><B>ggc-min-heapsize</B><DD>


Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <B>ggc-min-expand</B>% beyond <B>ggc-min-heapsize</B>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.


<P>


The default is the smaller of <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS,</FONT> or a limit that
tries to ensure that <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_DATA</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">RLIMIT_AS</FONT> are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is not able to calculate <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and <B>ggc-min-expand</B> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.
<DT id="1100"><B>max-reload-search-insns</B><DD>


The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent
register.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the
compilation time increase with probably slightly better performance.
<DT id="1101"><B>max-cselib-memory-locations</B><DD>


The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into account.
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time
increase with probably slightly better performance.
<DT id="1102"><B>max-sched-ready-insns</B><DD>


The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should
consider at any given time during the first scheduling pass.  Increasing
values mean more thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
with probably little benefit.
<DT id="1103"><B>max-sched-region-blocks</B><DD>


The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling.
<DT id="1104"><B>max-pipeline-region-blocks</B><DD>

for interblock speculative scheduling.
<DT id="1108"><B>max-sched-extend-regions-iters</B><DD>

memory locations.
<DT id="1113"><B>selsched-max-lookahead</B><DD>

depth of search for available instructions.
<DT id="1114"><B>selsched-max-sched-times</B><DD>


The maximum number of times that an instruction is scheduled during
selective scheduling.  This is the limit on the number of iterations
through which the instruction may be pipelined.
<DT id="1115"><B>selsched-insns-to-rename</B><DD>


The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list that are considered
for renaming in the selective scheduler.
<DT id="1116"><B>sms-min-sc</B><DD>


The minimum value of stage count that swing modulo scheduler
generates.
<DT id="1117"><B>max-last-value-rtl</B><DD>


The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be recorded in an expression
in combiner for a pseudo register as last known value of that register.
<DT id="1118"><B>max-combine-insns</B><DD>


The maximum number of instructions the <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> combiner tries to combine.
<DT id="1119"><B>integer-share-limit</B><DD>


Small integer constants can use a shared data structure, reducing the
compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.  This sets the maximum
value of a shared integer constant.
<DT id="1120"><B>ssp-buffer-size</B><DD>


The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that receive stack smashing
protection when <B>-fstack-protection</B> is used.


<P>


This default before Ubuntu 10.10 was ``8''. Currently it is ``4'', to increase
the number of functions protected by the stack protector.
<DT id="1121"><B>min-size-for-stack-sharing</B><DD>


The minimum size of variables taking part in stack slot sharing when not
optimizing.
<DT id="1122"><B>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts</B><DD>


Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be
duplicated when threading jumps.
<DT id="1123"><B>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</B><DD>


Maximum number of fields in a structure treated in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.
<DT id="1124"><B>prefetch-latency</B><DD>


Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed before
prefetch finishes.  The distance prefetched ahead is proportional
to this constant.  Increasing this number may also lead to less
streams being prefetched (see <B>simultaneous-prefetches</B>).
<DT id="1125"><B>simultaneous-prefetches</B><DD>


Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.
<DT id="1126"><B>l1-cache-line-size</B><DD>


The size of cache line in L1 data cache, in bytes.
<DT id="1127"><B>l1-cache-size</B><DD>


The size of L1 data cache, in kilobytes.
<DT id="1128"><B>l2-cache-size</B><DD>


The size of L2 data cache, in kilobytes.
<DT id="1129"><B>prefetch-dynamic-strides</B><DD>


Whether the loop array prefetch pass should issue software prefetch hints
for strides that are non-constant.  In some cases this may be
beneficial, though the fact the stride is non-constant may make it
hard to predict when there is clear benefit to issuing these hints.


<P>


Set to 1 if the prefetch hints should be issued for non-constant
strides.  Set to 0 if prefetch hints should be issued only for strides that
are known to be constant and below <B>prefetch-minimum-stride</B>.
<DT id="1130"><B>prefetch-minimum-stride</B><DD>


Minimum constant stride, in bytes, to start using prefetch hints for.  If
the stride is less than this threshold, prefetch hints will not be issued.


<P>


This setting is useful for processors that have hardware prefetchers, in
which case there may be conflicts between the hardware prefetchers and
the software prefetchers.  If the hardware prefetchers have a maximum
stride they can handle, it should be used here to improve the use of
software prefetchers.


<P>


A value of -1 means we don't have a threshold and therefore
prefetch hints can be issued for any constant stride.


<P>


This setting is only useful for strides that are known and constant.
<DT id="1131"><B>loop-interchange-max-num-stmts</B><DD>


The maximum number of stmts in a loop to be interchanged.
<DT id="1132"><B>loop-interchange-stride-ratio</B><DD>


The minimum ratio between stride of two loops for interchange to be profitable.
<DT id="1133"><B>min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio</B><DD>


The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.
<DT id="1134"><B>prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio</B><DD>


The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.
<DT id="1135"><B>use-canonical-types</B><DD>


Whether the compiler should use the ``canonical'' type system.
Should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal
mechanism for comparing types in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> and Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.  However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures,
set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.
<DT id="1136"><B>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</B><DD>


Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays that are
bigger than <B>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</B> times the number of
branches in the switch.
<DT id="1137"><B>max-partial-antic-length</B><DD>


Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (<B>-ftree-pre</B>) when
optimizing at <B>-O3</B> and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter allows an unlimited set length.
<DT id="1138"><B>rpo-vn-max-loop-depth</B><DD>


Maximum loop depth that is value-numbered optimistically.
When the limit hits the innermost
<I>rpo-vn-max-loop-depth</I> loops and the outermost loop in the
loop nest are value-numbered optimistically and the remaining ones not.
<DT id="1139"><B>sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access</B><DD>


Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking for
redundancies for loads and stores.  If this limit is hit the search
is aborted and the load or store is not considered redundant.  The
number of queries is algorithmically limited to the number of
stores on all paths from the load to the function entry.
<DT id="1140"><B>ira-max-loops-num</B><DD>


<FONT SIZE="-1">IRA</FONT> uses regional register allocation by default.  If a function
contains more loops than the number given by this parameter, only at most
the given number of the most frequently-executed loops form regions
for regional register allocation.
<DT id="1141"><B>ira-max-conflict-table-size</B><DD>


Although <FONT SIZE="-1">IRA</FONT> uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict
table, the table can still require excessive amounts of memory for
huge functions.  If the conflict table for a function could be more
than the size in <FONT SIZE="-1">MB</FONT> given by this parameter, the register allocator
instead uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality
algorithm that does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table.
<DT id="1142"><B>ira-loop-reserved-regs</B><DD>


<FONT SIZE="-1">IRA</FONT> can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops
for decisions to move loop invariants (see <B>-O3</B>).  The number
of available registers reserved for some other purposes is given
by this parameter.  Default of the parameter
is the best found from numerous experiments.
<DT id="1143"><B>lra-inheritance-ebb-probability-cutoff</B><DD>


<FONT SIZE="-1">LRA</FONT> tries to reuse values reloaded in registers in subsequent insns.
This optimization is called inheritance.  <FONT SIZE="-1">EBB</FONT> is used as a region to
do this optimization.  The parameter defines a minimal fall-through
edge probability in percentage used to add <FONT SIZE="-1">BB</FONT> to inheritance <FONT SIZE="-1">EBB</FONT> in
<FONT SIZE="-1">LRA.</FONT>  The default value was chosen
from numerous runs of <FONT SIZE="-1">SPEC2000</FONT> on x86-64.
<DT id="1144"><B>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop</B><DD>


Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and
in amount of needed compile-time memory, with very large loops.  Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
motion optimization performed on them.
<DT id="1145"><B>loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps</B><DD>


Building data dependencies is expensive for very large loops.  This
parameter limits the number of data references in loops that are
considered for data dependence analysis.  These large loops are no
handled by the optimizations using loop data dependencies.
<DT id="1146"><B>max-vartrack-size</B><DD>


Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.
<DT id="1147"><B>max-vartrack-expr-depth</B><DD>


Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to map
variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades
compilation time for more complete debug information.  If this is set too
low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in
debug information may end up not being used; setting this higher may
enable the compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile
time and memory use may grow.
<DT id="1148"><B>max-debug-marker-count</B><DD>


Sets a threshold on the number of debug markers (e.g. begin stmt
markers) to avoid complexity explosion at inlining or expanding to <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL.</FONT>
If a function has more such gimple stmts than the set limit, such stmts
will be dropped from the inlined copy of a function, and from its <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT>
expansion.
<DT id="1149"><B>min-nondebug-insn-uid</B><DD>


Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below
the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by
<B>-fvar-tracking-assignments</B>, but debug insns may get
(non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range is exhausted.
<DT id="1150"><B>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</B><DD>


IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new
parameters only when their cumulative size is less or equal to
<B>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</B> times the size of the original
pointer parameter.
<DT id="1151"><B>sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</B><DD>



<DT id="1152"><B>sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</B><DD>



The two Scalar Reduction of Aggregates passes (<FONT SIZE="-1">SRA</FONT> and IPA-SRA) aim to
replace scalar parts of aggregates with uses of independent scalar
variables.  These parameters control the maximum size, in storage units,
of aggregate which is considered for replacement when compiling for
speed
(<B>sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</B>) or size
(<B>sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</B>) respectively.
<DT id="1153"><B>sra-max-propagations</B><DD>


The maximum number of artificial accesses that Scalar Replacement of
Aggregates (<FONT SIZE="-1">SRA</FONT>) will track, per one local variable, in order to
facilitate copy propagation.
<DT id="1154"><B>tm-max-aggregate-size</B><DD>


When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this
parameter specifies the size in bytes after which variables are
saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore code
sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using
<B>-fgnu-tm</B>.
<DT id="1155"><B>graphite-max-nb-scop-params</B><DD>


To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.
A value of zero can be used to lift
the bound.  A variable whose value is unknown at compilation time and
defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.
<DT id="1156"><B>loop-block-tile-size</B><DD>


Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
<B>-floop-block</B> or <B>-floop-strip-mine</B>, strip mine each
loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
length can be changed using the <B>loop-block-tile-size</B>
parameter.
<DT id="1157"><B>ipa-cp-value-list-size</B><DD>


IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed to a function's
parameter in order to propagate them and perform devirtualization.
<B>ipa-cp-value-list-size</B> is the maximum number of values and types it
stores per one formal parameter of a function.
<DT id="1158"><B>ipa-cp-eval-threshold</B><DD>


IPA-CP calculates its own score of cloning profitability heuristics
and performs those cloning opportunities with scores that exceed
<B>ipa-cp-eval-threshold</B>.
<DT id="1159"><B>ipa-cp-recursion-penalty</B><DD>


Percentage penalty the recursive functions will receive when they
are evaluated for cloning.
<DT id="1160"><B>ipa-cp-single-call-penalty</B><DD>


Percentage penalty functions containing a single call to another
function will receive when they are evaluated for cloning.
<DT id="1161"><B>ipa-max-agg-items</B><DD>


IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar values passed
in an aggregate. <B>ipa-max-agg-items</B> controls the maximum
number of such values per one parameter.
<DT id="1162"><B>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</B><DD>


When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the number
of iterations of a loop known, it adds a bonus of
<B>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</B> to the profitability score of
the candidate.
<DT id="1163"><B>ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus</B><DD>


When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the index of
an array access known, it adds a bonus of
<B>ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus</B> to the profitability
score of the candidate.
<DT id="1164"><B>ipa-max-aa-steps</B><DD>


During its analysis of function bodies, IPA-CP employs alias analysis
in order to track values pointed to by function parameters.  In order
not spend too much time analyzing huge functions, it gives up and
consider all memory clobbered after examining

<H3>Program Instrumentation Options</H3>



<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports a number of command-line options that control adding
run-time instrumentation to the code it normally generates.  
For example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling
statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage
analysis, or profile-guided optimizations.
Another class of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking 
to detect programming errors like invalid pointer
dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately
hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> vtable hijacking.
There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other
forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or
program analysis purposes.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1237"><B>-p</B><DD>



<DT id="1238"><B>-pg</B><DD>



Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <B>prof</B> (for <B>-p</B>) or <B>gprof</B>
(for <B>-pg</B>).  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.


<P>


You can use the function attribute <TT>&quot;no_instrument_function&quot;</TT> to
suppress profiling of individual functions when compiling with these options.
<DT id="1239"><B>-fprofile-arcs</B><DD>


Add code so that program flow <I>arcs</I> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  On targets that support
constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles constructors,
destructors and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used
as a type of a global variable.


<P>


When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<I>auxname.gcda</I> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>), or for
test coverage analysis (<B>-ftest-coverage</B>).  Each object file's
<I>auxname</I> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. <I>foo.gcda</I> for input file <I>dir/foo.c</I>, or
<I>dir/foo.gcda</I> for output file specified as <B>-o dir/foo.o</B>).
<DT id="1240"><B>--coverage</B><DD>


This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>
<B>-ftest-coverage</B> (when compiling) and <B>-lgcov</B> (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1241"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1242">*<DD>
Compile the source files with <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <B>-ftest-coverage</B> option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.
<DT id="1243">*<DD>
Compile the source files additionally with <B>-fprofile-abs-path</B>
to create absolute path names in the <I>.gcno</I> files.  This allows
<B>gcov</B> to find the correct sources in projects where compilations
occur with different working directories.
<DT id="1244">*<DD>
Link your object files with <B>-lgcov</B> or <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>
(the latter implies the former).
<DT id="1245">*<DD>
Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Unless
a strict <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> dialect option is in effect, <TT>&quot;fork&quot;</TT> calls are
detected and correctly handled without double counting.
<DT id="1246">*<DD>
For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
<B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>.
<DT id="1247">*<DD>
For test coverage analysis, use <B>gcov</B> to produce human readable
information from the <I>.gcno</I> and <I>.gcda</I> files.  Refer to the
<B>gcov</B> documentation for further information.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1248"><DD>


<P>


With <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, for each function of your program <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.
</DL>

<DT id="1249"><B>-ftest-coverage</B><DD>


Produce a notes file that the <B>gcov</B> code-coverage utility can use to
show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called
<I>auxname.gcno</I>.  Refer to the <B>-fprofile-arcs</B> option
above for a description of <I>auxname</I> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data.  Coverage data matches the source files
more closely if you do not optimize.
<DT id="1250"><B>-fprofile-abs-path</B><DD>


Automatically convert relative source file names to absolute path names
in the <I>.gcno</I> files.  This allows <B>gcov</B> to find the correct
sources in projects where compilations occur with different working
directories.
<DT id="1251"><B>-fprofile-dir=</B><I>path</I><DD>


Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to <I>path</I>.
This option affects only the profile data generated by
<B>-fprofile-generate</B>, <B>-ftest-coverage</B>, <B>-fprofile-arcs</B>
and used by <B>-fprofile-use</B> and <B>-fbranch-probabilities</B>
and its related options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used.
By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses the current directory as <I>path</I>, thus the
profile data file appears in the same directory as the object file.
In order to prevent the file name clashing, if the object file name is
not an absolute path, we mangle the absolute path of the
<I>sourcename.gcda</I> file and use it as the file name of a
<I>.gcda</I> file.


<P>


When an executable is run in a massive parallel environment, it is recommended
to save profile to different folders.  That can be done with variables
in <I>path</I> that are exported during run-time:

<DT id="1256"><B>-fprofile-generate</B><DD>



<DT id="1257"><B>-fprofile-generate=</B><I>path</I><DD>



Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce
profile useful for later recompilation with profile feedback based
optimization.  You must use <B>-fprofile-generate</B> both when
compiling and when linking your program.


<P>


The following options are enabled:
<B>-fprofile-arcs</B>, <B>-fprofile-values</B>,
<B>-finline-functions</B>, and <B>-fipa-bit-cp</B>.


<P>


If <I>path</I> is specified, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> looks at the <I>path</I> to find
the profile feedback data files. See <B>-fprofile-dir</B>.


<P>


To optimize the program based on the collected profile information, use
<B>-fprofile-use</B>.
<DT id="1258"><B>-fprofile-update=</B><I>method</I><DD>


Alter the update method for an application instrumented for profile
feedback based optimization.  The <I>method</I> argument should be one of
<B>single</B>, <B>atomic</B> or <B>prefer-atomic</B>.
The first one is useful for single-threaded applications,
while the second one prevents profile corruption by emitting thread-safe code.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> When an application does not properly join all threads
(or creates an detached thread), a profile file can be still corrupted.


<P>


Using <B>prefer-atomic</B> would be transformed either to <B>atomic</B>,
when supported by a target, or to <B>single</B> otherwise.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver
automatically selects <B>prefer-atomic</B> when <B>-pthread</B>
is present in the command line.
<DT id="1259"><B>-fprofile-filter-files=</B><I>regex</I><DD>


Instrument only functions from files where names match
any regular expression (separated by a semi-colon).


<P>


For example, <B>-fprofile-filter-files=main.c;module.*.c</B> will instrument
only <I>main.c</I> and all C files starting with 'module'.
<DT id="1260"><B>-fprofile-exclude-files=</B><I>regex</I><DD>


Instrument only functions from files where names do not match
all the regular expressions (separated by a semi-colon).


<P>


For example, <B>-fprofile-exclude-files=/usr/*</B> will prevent instrumentation
of all files that are located in <I>/usr/</I> folder.
<DT id="1261"><B>-fsanitize=address</B><DD>

details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>TSAN_OPTIONS</B></FONT><B></B>
environment variable; see
&lt;<B><A HREF="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags</A></B>&gt; for a list of
supported options.
The option cannot be combined with <B>-fsanitize=address</B>,
<B>-fsanitize=leak</B>.


<P>


Note that sanitized atomic builtins cannot throw exceptions when
operating on invalid memory addresses with non-call exceptions
(<B>-fnon-call-exceptions</B>).
<DT id="1266"><B>-fsanitize=leak</B><DD>


Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.
This option only matters for linking of executables and
the executable is linked against a library that overrides <TT>&quot;malloc&quot;</TT>
and other allocator functions.  See
&lt;<B><A HREF="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer</A></B>&gt; for more
details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LSAN_OPTIONS</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable.
The option cannot be combined with <B>-fsanitize=thread</B>.
<DT id="1267"><B>-fsanitize=undefined</B><DD>


Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior detector.
Various computations are instrumented to detect undefined behavior
at runtime.  Current suboptions are:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1268"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1269"><B>-fsanitize=shift</B><DD>


This option enables checking that the result of a shift operation is
not undefined.  Note that what exactly is considered undefined differs
slightly between C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, as well as between <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90</FONT> and C99, etc.
This option has two suboptions, <B>-fsanitize=shift-base</B> and
<B>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</B>.
<DT id="1270"><B>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</B><DD>


This option enables checking that the second argument of a shift operation
is not negative and is smaller than the precision of the promoted first
argument.
<DT id="1271"><B>-fsanitize=shift-base</B><DD>


If the second argument of a shift operation is within range, check that the
result of a shift operation is not undefined.  Note that what exactly is
considered undefined differs slightly between C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, as well as between
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C90</FONT> and C99, etc.
<DT id="1272"><B>-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero</B><DD>


Detect integer division by zero as well as <TT>&quot;INT_MIN / -1&quot;</TT> division.
<DT id="1273"><B>-fsanitize=unreachable</B><DD>


With this option, the compiler turns the <TT>&quot;__builtin_unreachable&quot;</TT>
call into a diagnostics message call instead.  When reaching the
<TT>&quot;__builtin_unreachable&quot;</TT> call, the behavior is undefined.
<DT id="1274"><B>-fsanitize=vla-bound</B><DD>


This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of a variable
length array is positive.
<DT id="1275"><B>-fsanitize=null</B><DD>


This option enables pointer checking.  Particularly, the application
built with this option turned on will issue an error message when it
tries to dereference a <FONT SIZE="-1">NULL</FONT> pointer, or if a reference (possibly an
rvalue reference) is bound to a <FONT SIZE="-1">NULL</FONT> pointer, or if a method is invoked
on an object pointed by a <FONT SIZE="-1">NULL</FONT> pointer.
<DT id="1276"><B>-fsanitize=return</B><DD>


This option enables return statement checking.  Programs
built with this option turned on will issue an error message
when the end of a non-void function is reached without actually
returning a value.  This option works in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only.
<DT id="1277"><B>-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow</B><DD>


This option enables signed integer overflow checking.  We check that
the result of <TT>&quot;+&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;*&quot;</TT>, and both unary and binary <TT>&quot;-&quot;</TT>
does not overflow in the signed arithmetics.  Note, integer promotion
rules must be taken into account.  That is, the following is not an
overflow:


<P>




<PRE>
        signed char a = SCHAR_MAX;
        a++;

</PRE>


<DT id="1278"><B>-fsanitize=bounds</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of array bounds.  Various out of bounds
accesses are detected.  Flexible array members, flexible array member-like
arrays, and initializers of variables with static storage are not instrumented.
<DT id="1279"><B>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</B><DD>


This option enables strict instrumentation of array bounds.  Most out of bounds
accesses are detected, including flexible array members and flexible array
member-like arrays.  Initializers of variables with static storage are not
instrumented.
<DT id="1280"><B>-fsanitize=alignment</B><DD>


This option enables checking of alignment of pointers when they are
dereferenced, or when a reference is bound to insufficiently aligned target,
or when a method or constructor is invoked on insufficiently aligned object.
<DT id="1281"><B>-fsanitize=object-size</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of memory references using the
<TT>&quot;__builtin_object_size&quot;</TT> function.  Various out of bounds pointer
accesses are detected.
<DT id="1282"><B>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</B><DD>


Detect floating-point division by zero.  Unlike other similar options,
<B>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</B> is not enabled by
<B>-fsanitize=undefined</B>, since floating-point division by zero can
be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.
<DT id="1283"><B>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</B><DD>


This option enables floating-point type to integer conversion checking.
We check that the result of the conversion does not overflow.
Unlike other similar options, <B>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</B> is
not enabled by <B>-fsanitize=undefined</B>.
This option does not work well with <TT>&quot;FE_INVALID&quot;</TT> exceptions enabled.
<DT id="1284"><B>-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking whether null values
are not passed to arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the
<TT>&quot;nonnull&quot;</TT> function attribute.
<DT id="1285"><B>-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of return statements in functions
marked with <TT>&quot;returns_nonnull&quot;</TT> function attribute, to detect returning
of null values from such functions.
<DT id="1286"><B>-fsanitize=bool</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool.  If a value other
than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is issued.
<DT id="1287"><B>-fsanitize=enum</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum type.  If
a value outside the range of values for the enum type is loaded,
a run-time error is issued.
<DT id="1288"><B>-fsanitize=vptr</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> member function calls, member
accesses and some conversions between pointers to base and derived classes,
to verify the referenced object has the correct dynamic type.
<DT id="1289"><B>-fsanitize=pointer-overflow</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of pointer arithmetics.  If the pointer
arithmetics overflows, a run-time error is issued.
<DT id="1290"><B>-fsanitize=builtin</B><DD>


This option enables instrumentation of arguments to selected builtin
functions.  If an invalid value is passed to such arguments, a run-time
error is issued.  E.g. passing 0 as the argument to <TT>&quot;__builtin_ctz&quot;</TT>
or <TT>&quot;__builtin_clz&quot;</TT> invokes undefined behavior and is diagnosed
by this option.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1291"><DD>


<P>


While <B>-ftrapv</B> causes traps for signed overflows to be emitted,
<B>-fsanitize=undefined</B> gives a diagnostic message.
This currently works only for the C family of languages.
</DL>

<DT id="1292"><B>-fno-sanitize=all</B><DD>


This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers.
<B>-fsanitize=all</B> is not allowed, as some sanitizers cannot be used
together.
<DT id="1293"><B>-fasan-shadow-offset=</B><I>number</I><DD>


This option forces <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use custom shadow offset in AddressSanitizer checks.
It is useful for experimenting with different shadow memory layouts in
Kernel AddressSanitizer.
<DT id="1294"><B>-fsanitize-sections=</B><I>s1</I><B>,</B><I>s2</I><B>,...</B><DD>


Sanitize global variables in selected user-defined sections.  <I>si</I> may
contain wildcards.
<DT id="1295"><B>-fsanitize-recover</B>[<B>=</B><I>opts</I>]<DD>


<B>-fsanitize-recover=</B> controls error recovery mode for sanitizers
mentioned in comma-separated list of <I>opts</I>.  Enabling this option
for a sanitizer component causes it to attempt to continue
running the program as if no error happened.  This means multiple
runtime errors can be reported in a single program run, and the exit
code of the program may indicate success even when errors
have been reported.  The <B>-fno-sanitize-recover=</B> option
can be used to alter
this behavior: only the first detected error is reported
and program then exits with a non-zero exit code.


<P>


Currently this feature only works for <B>-fsanitize=undefined</B> (and its suboptions
except for <B>-fsanitize=unreachable</B> and <B>-fsanitize=return</B>),
<B>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</B>, <B>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</B>,
<B>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</B>,
<B>-fsanitize=kernel-address</B> and <B>-fsanitize=address</B>.
For these sanitizers error recovery is turned on by default,
except <B>-fsanitize=address</B>, for which this feature is experimental.
<B>-fsanitize-recover=all</B> and <B>-fno-sanitize-recover=all</B> is also
accepted, the former enables recovery for all sanitizers that support it,
the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers that support it.


<P>


Even if a recovery mode is turned on the compiler side, it needs to be also
enabled on the runtime library side, otherwise the failures are still fatal.
The runtime library defaults to <TT>&quot;halt_on_error=0&quot;</TT> for
ThreadSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, while default value for
AddressSanitizer is <TT>&quot;halt_on_error=1&quot;</TT>. This can be overridden through
setting the <TT>&quot;halt_on_error&quot;</TT> flag in the corresponding environment variable.


<P>


Syntax without an explicit <I>opts</I> parameter is deprecated.  It is
equivalent to specifying an <I>opts</I> list of:


<P>




<PRE>
        undefined,float-cast-overflow,float-divide-by-zero,bounds-strict

</PRE>


<DT id="1296"><B>-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</B><DD>


Enable sanitization of local variables to detect use-after-scope bugs.
The option sets <B>-fstack-reuse</B> to <B>none</B>.
<DT id="1297"><B>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</B><DD>


The <B>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</B> option instructs the compiler to
report undefined behavior using <TT>&quot;__builtin_trap&quot;</TT> rather than
a <TT>&quot;libubsan&quot;</TT> library routine.  The advantage of this is that the
<TT>&quot;libubsan&quot;</TT> library is not needed and is not linked in, so this
is usable even in freestanding environments.
<DT id="1298"><B>-fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc</B><DD>


Enable coverage-guided fuzzing code instrumentation.
Inserts a call to <TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc&quot;</TT> into every basic block.
<DT id="1299"><B>-fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp</B><DD>


Enable dataflow guided fuzzing code instrumentation.
Inserts a call to <TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp1&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp2&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp8&quot;</TT> for integral comparison with both operands
variable or <TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp1&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp2&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp4&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp8&quot;</TT> for integral comparison with one
operand constant, <TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmpf&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmpd&quot;</TT> for float or double comparisons and
<TT>&quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_switch&quot;</TT> for switch statements.
<DT id="1300"><B>-fcf-protection=</B>[<B>full</B>|<B>branch</B>|<B>return</B>|<B>none</B>|<B>check</B>]<DD>


Enable code instrumentation of control-flow transfers to increase
program security by checking that target addresses of control-flow
transfer instructions (such as indirect function call, function return,
indirect jump) are valid.  This prevents diverting the flow of control
to an unexpected target.  This is intended to protect against such
threats as Return-oriented Programming (<FONT SIZE="-1">ROP</FONT>), and similarly
call/jmp-oriented programming (<FONT SIZE="-1">COP/JOP</FONT>).


<P>


The value <TT>&quot;branch&quot;</TT> tells the compiler to implement checking of
validity of control-flow transfer at the point of indirect branch
instructions, i.e. call/jmp instructions.  The value <TT>&quot;return&quot;</TT>
implements checking of validity at the point of returning from a
function.  The value <TT>&quot;full&quot;</TT> is an alias for specifying both
<TT>&quot;branch&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;return&quot;</TT>. The value <TT>&quot;none&quot;</TT> turns off
instrumentation.


<P>


The value <TT>&quot;check&quot;</TT> is used for the final link with link-time
optimization (<FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT>).  An error is issued if <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> object files are
compiled with different <B>-fcf-protection</B> values.  The
value <TT>&quot;check&quot;</TT> is ignored at the compile time.


<P>


The macro <TT>&quot;__CET__&quot;</TT> is defined when <B>-fcf-protection</B> is
used.  The first bit of <TT>&quot;__CET__&quot;</TT> is set to 1 for the value
<TT>&quot;branch&quot;</TT> and the second bit of <TT>&quot;__CET__&quot;</TT> is set to 1 for
the <TT>&quot;return&quot;</TT>.


<P>


You can also use the <TT>&quot;nocf_check&quot;</TT> attribute to identify
which functions and calls should be skipped from instrumentation.


<P>


Currently the x86 GNU/Linux target provides an implementation based
on Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (<FONT SIZE="-1">CET</FONT>).


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> In Ubuntu 19.10 and later versions, <B>-fcf-protection</B>
is enabled by default for C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, ObjC, ObjC++, if none of
<B>-fno-cf-protection</B> nor <B>-fcf-protection=*</B> are found.
<DT id="1301"><B>-fstack-protector</B><DD>


Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT>, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
<DT id="1302"><B>-fstack-protector-all</B><DD>


Like <B>-fstack-protector</B> except that all functions are protected.
<DT id="1303"><B>-fstack-protector-strong</B><DD>


Like <B>-fstack-protector</B> but includes additional functions to
be protected --- those that have local array definitions, or have
references to local frame addresses.
<DT id="1304"><B>-fstack-protector-explicit</B><DD>


Like <B>-fstack-protector</B> but only protects those functions which
have the <TT>&quot;stack_protect&quot;</TT> attribute.
<DT id="1305"><B>-fstack-check</B><DD>


Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.


<P>


Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.


<P>


You can additionally specify a string parameter: <B>no</B> means no
checking, <B>generic</B> means force the use of old-style checking,
<B>specific</B> means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare <B>-fstack-check</B>.


<P>


Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1306"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1307">1.<DD>


Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.  Note this
may change the semantics of some code.
<DT id="1308">2.<DD>


Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.
<DT id="1309">3.<DD>


Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, code performance is hampered.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1310"><DD>


<P>


Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
<B>specific</B> if no target support has been added in the compiler.


<P>


<B>-fstack-check=</B> is designed for Ada's needs to detect infinite recursion
and stack overflows.  <B>specific</B> is an excellent choice when compiling
Ada code.  It is not generally sufficient to protect against stack-clash
attacks.  To protect against those you want <B>-fstack-clash-protection</B>.
</DL>

<DT id="1311"><B>-fstack-clash-protection</B><DD>


Generate code to prevent stack clash style attacks.  When this option is
enabled, the compiler will only allocate one page of stack space at a time
and each page is accessed immediately after allocation.  Thus, it prevents
allocations from jumping over any stack guard page provided by the
operating system.


<P>


Most targets do not fully support stack clash protection.  However, on
those targets <B>-fstack-clash-protection</B> will protect dynamic stack
allocations.  <B>-fstack-clash-protection</B> may also provide limited
protection for static stack allocations if the target supports
<B>-fstack-check=specific</B>.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> In Ubuntu 19.10 and later versions,
<B>-fstack-clash-protection</B> is enabled by default for C,
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>, ObjC, ObjC++, unless <B>-fno-stack-clash-protection</B> is found.
<DT id="1312"><B>-fstack-limit-register=</B><I>reg</I><DD>



<DT id="1313"><B>-fstack-limit-symbol=</B><I>sym</I><DD>


<DT id="1314"><B>-fno-stack-limit</B><DD>



Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If a larger
stack is required, a signal is raised at run time.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.


<P>


For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <B>0x80000000</B>
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
<B>-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit</B> and
<B>-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</B> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker.


<P>


You can locally override stack limit checking by using the
<TT>&quot;no_stack_limit&quot;</TT> function attribute.
<DT id="1315"><B>-fsplit-stack</B><DD>


Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.  This
is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer
necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the x86 targets running
GNU/Linux.


<P>


When code compiled with <B>-fsplit-stack</B> calls code compiled
without <B>-fsplit-stack</B>, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with <B>-fsplit-stack</B> is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without <B>-fsplit-stack</B> always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> binutils release 2.21
and later.
<DT id="1316"><B>-fvtable-verify=</B>[<B>std</B>|<B>preinit</B>|<B>none</B>]<DD>


This option is only available when compiling C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> code.
It turns on (or off, if using <B>-fvtable-verify=none</B>) the security
feature that verifies at run time, for every virtual call, that
the vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of
the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable
pointer is detected at run time, an error is reported and execution of the
program is immediately halted.


<P>


This option causes run-time data structures to be built at program startup,
which are used for verifying the vtable pointers.  
The options <B>std</B> and <B>preinit</B>
control the timing of when these data structures are built.  In both cases the
data structures are built before execution reaches <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>.  Using
<B>-fvtable-verify=std</B> causes the data structures to be built after
shared libraries have been loaded and initialized.
<B>-fvtable-verify=preinit</B> causes them to be built before shared
libraries have been loaded and initialized.


<P>


If this option appears multiple times in the command line with different
values specified, <B>none</B> takes highest priority over both <B>std</B> and
<B>preinit</B>; <B>preinit</B> takes priority over <B>std</B>.
<DT id="1317"><B>-fvtv-debug</B><DD>


When used in conjunction with <B>-fvtable-verify=std</B> or 
<B>-fvtable-verify=preinit</B>, causes debug versions of the 
runtime functions for the vtable verification feature to be called.  
This flag also causes the compiler to log information about which 
vtable pointers it finds for each class.
This information is written to a file named <I>vtv_set_ptr_data.log</I> 
in the directory named by the environment variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>VTV_LOGS_DIR</B></FONT><B></B> 
if that is defined or the current working directory otherwise.


<P>


Note:  This feature <I>appends</I> data to the log file. If you want a fresh log
file, be sure to delete any existing one.
<DT id="1318"><B>-fvtv-counts</B><DD>


This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with
<B>-fvtable-verify=std</B> or <B>-fvtable-verify=preinit</B>, this
causes the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls
it encounters and the number of verifications it inserts.  It also
counts the number of calls to certain run-time library functions
that it inserts and logs this information for each compilation unit.
The compiler writes this information to a file named
<I>vtv_count_data.log</I> in the directory named by the environment
variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>VTV_LOGS_DIR</B></FONT><B></B> if that is defined or the current working
directory otherwise.  It also counts the size of the vtable pointer sets
for each class, and writes this information to <I>vtv_class_set_sizes.log</I>
in the same directory.


<P>


Note:  This feature <I>appends</I> data to the log files.  To get fresh log
files, be sure to delete any existing ones.
<DT id="1319"><B>-finstrument-functions</B><DD>


Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<TT>&quot;__builtin_return_address&quot;</TT> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)


<P>




<PRE>
        void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                       void *call_site);
        void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                       void *call_site);

</PRE>




<P>


The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.


<P>


This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <TT>&quot;extern inline&quot;</TT> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)


<P>


A function may be given the attribute <TT>&quot;no_instrument_function&quot;</TT>, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).
<DT id="1320"><B>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=</B><I>file</I><B>,</B><I>file</I><B>,...</B><DD>


Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of <B>-finstrument-functions</B>).  If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of <I>file</I>, then
that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the <I>file</I> parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.


<P>


For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys

</PRE>




<P>


excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
contain <I>/bits/stl</I> or <I>include/sys</I>.


<P>


If, for some reason, you want to include letter <B>,</B> in one of
<I>sym</I>, write <B>,</B>. For example,
<B>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=',,tmp'</B>
(note the single quote surrounding the option).
<DT id="1321"><B>-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=</B><I>sym</I><B>,</B><I>sym</I><B>,...</B><DD>


This is similar to <B>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</B>,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as <TT>&quot;vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)&quot;</TT>, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., <TT>&quot;_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE&quot;</TT>).  The
match is done on substrings: if the <I>sym</I> parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8,</FONT> not
using universal character names.
<DT id="1322"><B>-fpatchable-function-entry=</B><I>N</I><B>[,</B><I>M</I><B>]</B><DD>


Generate <I>N</I> NOPs right at the beginning
of each function, with the function entry point before the <I>M</I>th <FONT SIZE="-1">NOP.</FONT>
If <I>M</I> is omitted, it defaults to <TT>0</TT> so the
function entry points to the address just at the first <FONT SIZE="-1">NOP.</FONT>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">NOP</FONT> instructions reserve extra space which can be used to patch in
any desired instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment
is writable.  The amount of space is controllable indirectly via
the number of NOPs; the <FONT SIZE="-1">NOP</FONT> instruction used corresponds to the instruction
emitted by the internal <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> back-end interface <TT>&quot;gen_nop&quot;</TT>.  This behavior
is target-specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or
other compilation options.


<P>


For run-time identification, the starting addresses of these areas,
which correspond to their respective function entries minus <I>M</I>,
are additionally collected in the <TT>&quot;__patchable_function_entries&quot;</TT>
section of the resulting binary.


<P>


Note that the value of <TT>&quot;__attribute__ ((patchable_function_entry
(N,M)))&quot;</TT> takes precedence over command-line option
<B>-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</B>.  This can be used to increase
the area size or to remove it completely on a single function.
If <TT>&quot;N=0&quot;</TT>, no pad location is recorded.


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">NOP</FONT> instructions are inserted at---and maybe before, depending on
<I>M</I>---the function entry address, even before the prologue.

<H3>Options Controlling the Preprocessor</H3>



These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
<P>

If you use the <B>-E</B> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with <B>-E</B> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
<P>

In addition to the options listed here, there are a number of options 
to control search paths for include files documented in 
<B>Directory Options</B>.  
Options to control preprocessor diagnostics are listed in 
<B>Warning Options</B>.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1323"><B>-D</B> <I>name</I><DD>


Predefine <I>name</I> as a macro, with definition <TT>1</TT>.
<DT id="1324"><B>-D</B> <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>definition</I><DD>


The contents of <I>definition</I> are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a <B>#define</B>
directive.  In particular, the definition is truncated by
embedded newline characters.


<P>


If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.


<P>


If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you should
quote the option.  With <B>sh</B> and <B>csh</B>,
<B>-D'</B><I>name</I><B>(</B><I>args...</I><B>)=</B><I>definition</I><B>'</B> works.


<P>


<B>-D</B> and <B>-U</B> options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All <B>-imacros</B> <I>file</I> and
<B>-include</B> <I>file</I> options are processed after all
<B>-D</B> and <B>-U</B> options.
<DT id="1325"><B>-U</B> <I>name</I><DD>


Cancel any previous definition of <I>name</I>, either built in or
provided with a <B>-D</B> option.
<DT id="1326"><B>-include</B> <I>file</I><DD>


Process <I>file</I> as if <TT>&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;</TT> appeared as the first
line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
for <I>file</I> is the preprocessor's working directory <I>instead of</I>
the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
is searched for in the remainder of the <TT>&quot;#include &quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT> search
chain as normal.


<P>


If multiple <B>-include</B> options are given, the files are included
in the order they appear on the command line.
<DT id="1327"><B>-imacros</B> <I>file</I><DD>


Exactly like <B>-include</B>, except that any output produced by
scanning <I>file</I> is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
processing its declarations.


<P>


All files specified by <B>-imacros</B> are processed before all files
specified by <B>-include</B>.
<DT id="1328"><B>-undef</B><DD>


Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
<DT id="1329"><B>-pthread</B><DD>


Define additional macros required for using the <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> threads library.
You should use this option consistently for both compilation and linking.
This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives,
and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.
<DT id="1330"><B>-M</B><DD>


Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <B>make</B> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <B>make</B> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from <B>-include</B> or
<B>-imacros</B> command-line options.


<P>


Unless specified explicitly (with <B>-MT</B> or <B>-MQ</B>), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using <B>\</B>-newline.  The rule has no
commands.


<P>


This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
<B>-dM</B>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
<B>-MF</B>, or use an environment variable like
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></FONT><B></B>.  Debug output
is still sent to the regular output stream as normal.


<P>


Passing <B>-M</B> to the driver implies <B>-E</B>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit <B>-w</B>.
<DT id="1331"><B>-MM</B><DD>


Like <B>-M</B> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.


<P>


This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
<B>#include</B> directive does not in itself determine whether that
header appears in <B>-MM</B> dependency output.
<DT id="1332"><B>-MF</B> <I>file</I><DD>


When used with <B>-M</B> or <B>-MM</B>, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no <B>-MF</B> switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send
preprocessed output.


<P>


When used with the driver options <B>-MD</B> or <B>-MMD</B>,
<B>-MF</B> overrides the default dependency output file.


<P>


If <I>file</I> is <I>-</I>, then the dependencies are written to <I>stdout</I>.
<DT id="1333"><B>-MG</B><DD>


In conjunction with an option such as <B>-M</B> requesting
dependency generation, <B>-MG</B> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<TT>&quot;#include&quot;</TT> directive without prepending any path.  <B>-MG</B>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.


<P>


This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
<DT id="1334"><B>-MP</B><DD>


This option instructs <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors <B>make</B> gives if you remove header
files without updating the <I>Makefile</I> to match.


<P>


This is typical output:


<P>




<PRE>
        test.o: test.c test.h
        
        test.h:

</PRE>


<DT id="1335"><B>-MT</B> <I>target</I><DD>


Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as <B>.c</B>, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.


<P>


An <B>-MT</B> option sets the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <B>-MT</B>, or use multiple <B>-MT</B> options.


<P>


For example, <B>-MT&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</B> might give


<P>




<PRE>
        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

</PRE>


<DT id="1336"><B>-MQ</B> <I>target</I><DD>


Same as <B>-MT</B>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  <B>-MQ&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</B> gives


<P>




<PRE>
        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

</PRE>




<P>


The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<B>-MQ</B>.
<DT id="1337"><B>-MD</B><DD>


<B>-MD</B> is equivalent to <B>-M -MF</B> <I>file</I>, except that
<B>-E</B> is not implied.  The driver determines <I>file</I> based on
whether an <B>-o</B> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of <I>.d</I>, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a <I>.d</I> suffix.


<P>


If <B>-MD</B> is used in conjunction with <B>-E</B>, any
<B>-o</B> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without <B>-E</B>, each <B>-o</B>
is understood to specify a target object file.


<P>


Since <B>-E</B> is not implied, <B>-MD</B> can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation process.
<DT id="1338"><B>-MMD</B><DD>


Like <B>-MD</B> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
<DT id="1339"><B>-fpreprocessed</B><DD>


Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with <B>-C</B> to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.


<P>


<B>-fpreprocessed</B> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions <B>.i</B>, <B>.ii</B> or <B>.mi</B>.  These are the
extensions that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses for preprocessed files created by
<B>-save-temps</B>.
<DT id="1340"><B>-fdirectives-only</B><DD>


When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.


<P>


The option's behavior depends on the <B>-E</B> and <B>-fpreprocessed</B>
options.


<P>


With <B>-E</B>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as <TT>&quot;#define&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;#ifdef&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;#error&quot;</TT>.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the <B>-dD</B> option is
implicitly enabled.


<P>


With <B>-fpreprocessed</B>, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as <TT>&quot;__LINE__&quot;</TT>, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with <TT>&quot;-E -fdirectives-only&quot;</TT>.


<P>


With both <B>-E</B> and <B>-fpreprocessed</B>, the rules for
<B>-fpreprocessed</B> take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with <TT>&quot;-E -fdirectives-only&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="1341"><B>-fdollars-in-identifiers</B><DD>


Accept <B>$</B> in identifiers.
<DT id="1342"><B>-fextended-identifiers</B><DD>


Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
<DT id="1343"><B>-fno-canonical-system-headers</B><DD>


When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.
<DT id="1344"><B>-ftabstop=</B><I>width</I><DD>


Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.
<DT id="1345"><B>-ftrack-macro-expansion</B>[<B>=</B><I>level</I>]<DD>


Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The <I>level</I> parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value <B>0</B> of <I>level</I> de-activates
this option. Value <B>1</B> tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value <B>2</B> tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
<B>2</B>.


<P>


Note that <TT>&quot;-ftrack-macro-expansion=2&quot;</TT> is activated by default.
<DT id="1346"><B>-fmacro-prefix-map=</B><I>old</I><B>=</B><I>new</I><DD>


When preprocessing files residing in directory <I>old</I>,
expand the <TT>&quot;__FILE__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__BASE_FILE__&quot;</TT> macros as if the
files resided in directory <I>new</I> instead.  This can be used
to change an absolute path to a relative path by using <I>.</I> for
<I>new</I> which can result in more reproducible builds that are
location independent.  This option also affects
<TT>&quot;__builtin_FILE()&quot;</TT> during compilation.  See also
<B>-ffile-prefix-map</B>.
<DT id="1347"><B>-fexec-charset=</B><I>charset</I><DD>


Set the execution character set, used for string and character
constants.  The default is <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8.</FONT>  <I>charset</I> can be any encoding
supported by the system's <TT>&quot;iconv&quot;</TT> library routine.
<DT id="1348"><B>-fwide-exec-charset=</B><I>charset</I><DD>


Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-32</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16,</FONT> whichever
corresponds to the width of <TT>&quot;wchar_t&quot;</TT>.  As with
<B>-fexec-charset</B>, <I>charset</I> can be any encoding supported
by the system's <TT>&quot;iconv&quot;</TT> library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in <TT>&quot;wchar_t&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="1349"><B>-finput-charset=</B><I>charset</I><DD>


Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  If the
locale does not specify, or <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8.</FONT>  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command-line option.  Currently the command-line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  <I>charset</I> can be any encoding
supported by the system's <TT>&quot;iconv&quot;</TT> library routine.
<DT id="1350"><B>-fpch-deps</B><DD>


When using precompiled headers, this flag
causes the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified, only the
precompiled header are listed and not the files that were used to
create it, because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
<DT id="1351"><B>-fpch-preprocess</B><DD>


This option allows use of a precompiled header together with <B>-E</B>.  It inserts a special <TT>&quot;#pragma&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;#pragma GCC pch_preprocess &quot;</TT>filename<TT>&quot;&quot;</TT> in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its <I>filename</I>.
When <B>-fpreprocessed</B> is in use, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> recognizes this <TT>&quot;#pragma&quot;</TT>
and loads the <FONT SIZE="-1">PCH.</FONT>


<P>


This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  It is switched on by
<B>-save-temps</B>.


<P>


You should not write this <TT>&quot;#pragma&quot;</TT> in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the <FONT SIZE="-1">PCH</FONT> file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s
current directory.
<DT id="1352"><B>-fworking-directory</B><DD>


Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor
emits, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form <B>-fno-working-directory</B>.  If the <B>-P</B> flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
<TT>&quot;#line&quot;</TT> directives are emitted whatsoever.
<DT id="1353"><B>-A</B> <I>predicate</I><B>=</B><I>answer</I><DD>


Make an assertion with the predicate <I>predicate</I> and answer
<I>answer</I>.  This form is preferred to the older form <B>-A</B>
<I>predicate</I><B>(</B><I>answer</I><B>)</B>, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.
<DT id="1354"><B>-A -</B><I>predicate</I><B>=</B><I>answer</I><DD>


Cancel an assertion with the predicate <I>predicate</I> and answer
<I>answer</I>.
<DT id="1355"><B>-C</B><DD>


Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.


<P>


You should be prepared for side effects when using <B>-C</B>; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a <B>#</B>.
<DT id="1356"><B>-CC</B><DD>


Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like <B>-C</B>, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.


<P>


In addition to the side effects of the <B>-C</B> option, the
<B>-CC</B> option causes all C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.


<P>


The <B>-CC</B> option is generally used to support lint comments.
<DT id="1357"><B>-P</B><DD>


Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.
This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.
<DT id="1358"><B>-traditional</B><DD>



<DT id="1359"><B>-traditional-cpp</B><DD>



Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors, as
opposed to <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> preprocessors.
See the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU CPP</FONT> manual for details.


<P>


Note that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not otherwise attempt to emulate a pre-standard 
C compiler, and these options are only supported with the <B>-E</B> 
switch, or when invoking <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> explicitly.
<DT id="1360"><B>-trigraphs</B><DD>


Support <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> trigraphs.
These are three-character sequences, all starting with <B>??</B>, that
are defined by <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C</FONT> to stand for single characters.  For example,
<B>??/</B> stands for <B>\</B>, so <B>'??/n'</B> is a character
constant for a newline.


<P>


The nine trigraphs and their replacements are


<P>




<PRE>
        Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??&lt;  ??&gt;  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
        Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~

</PRE>




<P>


By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the <B>-std</B> and
<B>-ansi</B> options.
<DT id="1361"><B>-remap</B><DD>


Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit very
short file names, such as MS-DOS.
<DT id="1362"><B>-H</B><DD>


Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the
<B>#include</B> stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also
printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled
header file is printed with <B>...x</B> and a valid one with <B>...!</B> .
<DT id="1363"><B>-d</B><I>letters</I><DD>


Says to make debugging dumps during compilation as specified by
<I>letters</I>.  The flags documented here are those relevant to the
preprocessor.  Other <I>letters</I> are interpreted
by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> and so
are silently ignored.  If you specify <I>letters</I> whose behavior
conflicts, the result is undefined.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1364"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1365"><B>-dM</B><DD>


Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <B>#define</B>
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file <I>foo.h</I>, the command


<P>




<PRE>
        touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

</PRE>




<P>


shows all the predefined macros.


<P>


If you use <B>-dM</B> without the <B>-E</B> option, <B>-dM</B> is
interpreted as a synonym for <B>-fdump-rtl-mach</B>.
<DT id="1366"><B>-dD</B><DD>


Like <B>-dM</B> except in two respects: it does <I>not</I> include the
predefined macros, and it outputs <I>both</I> the <B>#define</B>
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.
<DT id="1367"><B>-dN</B><DD>


Like <B>-dD</B>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.
<DT id="1368"><B>-dI</B><DD>


Output <B>#include</B> directives in addition to the result of
preprocessing.
<DT id="1369"><B>-dU</B><DD>


Like <B>-dD</B> except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the
output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
<B>#undef</B> directives are also output for macros tested but
undefined at the time.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1370"><DD>
</DL>

<DT id="1371"><B>-fdebug-cpp</B><DD>


This option is only useful for debugging <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  When used from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPP</FONT> or with
<B>-E</B>, it dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every
token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location
belongs to.


<P>


When used from <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> without <B>-E</B>, this option has no effect.
<DT id="1372"><B>-Wp,</B><I>option</I><DD>


You can use <B>-Wp,</B><I>option</I> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <I>option</I> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
<I>option</I> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
<B>-Wp</B> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using <B>-Wp</B> and let the driver handle the
options instead.
<DT id="1373"><B>-Xpreprocessor</B> <I>option</I><DD>


Pass <I>option</I> as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not 
recognize.


<P>


If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<B>-Xpreprocessor</B> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
<DT id="1374"><B>-no-integrated-cpp</B><DD>


Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> performs preprocessing as an integrated part of
input tokenization and parsing.
If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end
(<B>cc1</B>, <B>cc1plus</B>, or <B>cc1obj</B> for C, C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>,
and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation
of the preprocessed input.
This option may be useful in conjunction with the <B>-B</B> or
<B>-wrapper</B> options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.

<H3>Options for Linking</H3>



These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1377"><I>object-file-name</I><DD>


A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.
<DT id="1378"><B>-c</B><DD>



<DT id="1379"><B>-S</B><DD>


<DT id="1380"><B>-E</B><DD>



If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.
<DT id="1381"><B>-flinker-output=</B><I>type</I><DD>


This option controls the code generation of the link time optimizer.  By
default the linker output is determined by the linker plugin automatically. For
debugging the compiler and in the case of incremental linking to non-lto object
file is desired, it may be useful to control the type manually.


<P>


If <I>type</I> is <B>exec</B> the code generation is configured to produce static
binary. In this case <B>-fpic</B> and <B>-fpie</B> are both disabled.


<P>


If <I>type</I> is <B>dyn</B> the code generation is configured to produce shared
library. In this case <B>-fpic</B> or <B>-fPIC</B> is preserved, but not
enabled automatically.  This makes it possible to build shared libraries without
position independent code on architectures this is possible, i.e. on x86.


<P>


If <I>type</I> is <B>pie</B> the code generation is configured to produce
<B>-fpie</B> executable. This result in similar optimizations as <B>exec</B>
except that <B>-fpie</B> is not disabled if specified at compilation time.


<P>


If <I>type</I> is <B>rel</B> the compiler assumes that incremental linking is
done.  The sections containing intermediate code for link-time optimization are
merged, pre-optimized, and output to the resulting object file. In addition, if
<B>-ffat-lto-objects</B> is specified the binary code is produced for future
non-lto linking. The object file produced by incremental linking will be smaller
than a static library produced from the same object files.  At link-time the
result of incremental linking will also load faster to compiler than a static
library assuming that majority of objects in the library are used.


<P>


Finally <B>nolto-rel</B> configure compiler to for incremental linking where
code generation is forced, final binary is produced and the intermediate code
for later link-time optimization is stripped. When multiple object files are
linked together the resulting code will be optimized better than with link time
optimizations disabled (for example, the cross-module inlining will happen),
most of benefits of whole program optimizations are however lost.


<P>


During the incremental link (by <B>-r</B>) the linker plugin will default to
<B>rel</B>. With current interfaces to <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> Binutils it is however not
possible to link incrementally <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> objects and non-LTO objects into a single
mixed object file.  In the case any of object files in incremental link cannot
be used for link-time optimization the linker plugin will output warning and
use <B>nolto-rel</B>. To maintain the whole program optimization it is
recommended to link such objects into static library instead. Alternatively it
is possible to use H.J. Lu's binutils with support for mixed objects.
<DT id="1382"><B>-fuse-ld=bfd</B><DD>


Use the <B>bfd</B> linker instead of the default linker.
<DT id="1383"><B>-fuse-ld=gold</B><DD>


Use the <B>gold</B> linker instead of the default linker.
<DT id="1384"><B>-fuse-ld=lld</B><DD>


Use the <FONT SIZE="-1">LLVM</FONT> <B>lld</B> linker instead of the default linker.
<DT id="1385"><B>-l</B><I>library</I><DD>



<DT id="1386"><B>-l</B> <I>library</I><DD>



Search the library named <I>library</I> when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
<FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> compliance and is not recommended.)


<P>


The <B>-l</B> option is passed directly to the linker by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  Refer
to your linker documentation for exact details.  The general
description below applies to the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker.


<P>


The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library.
The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <B>-L</B>.


<P>


Static libraries are archives of object files, and have file names
like <I>liblibrary.a</I>.  Some targets also support shared
libraries, which typically have names like <I>liblibrary.so</I>.
If both static and shared libraries are found, the linker gives
preference to linking with the shared library unless the
<B>-static</B> option is used.


<P>


It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, <B>foo.o -lz bar.o</B> searches library <B>z</B>
after file <I>foo.o</I> but before <I>bar.o</I>.  If <I>bar.o</I> refers
to functions in <B>z</B>, those functions may not be loaded.
<DT id="1387"><B>-lobjc</B><DD>


You need this special case of the <B>-l</B> option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective-C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> program.
<DT id="1388"><B>-nostartfiles</B><DD>


Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless <B>-nostdlib</B>,
<B>-nolibc</B>, or <B>-nodefaultlibs</B> is used.
<DT id="1389"><B>-nodefaultlibs</B><DD>


Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as <B>-static-libgcc</B>
or <B>-shared-libgcc</B>, are ignored.  
The standard startup files are used normally, unless <B>-nostartfiles</B>
is used.


<P>


The compiler may generate calls to <TT>&quot;memcmp&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;memmove&quot;</TT>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
<DT id="1390"><B>-nolibc</B><DD>


Do not use the C library or system libraries tightly coupled with it when
linking.  Still link with the startup files, <I>libgcc</I> or toolchain
provided language support libraries such as <I>libgnat</I>, <I>libgfortran</I>
or <I>libstdc++</I> unless options preventing their inclusion are used as
well.  This typically removes <B>-lc</B> from the link command line, as well
as system libraries that normally go with it and become meaningless when
absence of a C library is assumed, for example <B>-lpthread</B> or
<B>-lm</B> in some configurations.  This is intended for bare-board
targets when there is indeed no C library available.
<DT id="1391"><B>-nostdlib</B><DD>


Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to
the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
<B>-static-libgcc</B> or <B>-shared-libgcc</B>, are ignored.


<P>


The compiler may generate calls to <TT>&quot;memcmp&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;memset&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;memmove&quot;</TT>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.


<P>


One of the standard libraries bypassed by <B>-nostdlib</B> and
<B>-nodefaultlibs</B> is <I>libgcc.a</I>, a library of internal subroutines
which <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.


<P>


In most cases, you need <I>libgcc.a</I> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <B>-nostdlib</B>
or <B>-nodefaultlibs</B> you should usually specify <B>-lgcc</B> as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
library subroutines.
(An example of such an internal subroutine is <TT>&quot;__main&quot;</TT>, used to ensure C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
constructors are called.)
<DT id="1392"><B>-e</B> <I>entry</I><DD>



<DT id="1393"><B>--entry=</B><I>entry</I><DD>



Specify that the program entry point is <I>entry</I>.  The argument is
interpreted by the linker; the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker accepts either a symbol name
or an address.
<DT id="1394"><B>-pie</B><DD>


Produce a dynamically linked position independent executable on targets
that support it.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same
set of options used for compilation (<B>-fpie</B>, <B>-fPIE</B>,
or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
<DT id="1395"><B>-no-pie</B><DD>


Don't produce a dynamically linked position independent executable.
<DT id="1396"><B>-static-pie</B><DD>


Produce a static position independent executable on targets that support
it.  A static position independent executable is similar to a static
executable, but can be loaded at any address without a dynamic linker.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
used for compilation (<B>-fpie</B>, <B>-fPIE</B>, or model
suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
<DT id="1397"><B>-pthread</B><DD>


Link with the <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> threads library.  This option is supported on 
GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on 
x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.  On some targets this option also sets 
flags for the preprocessor, so it should be used consistently for both
compilation and linking.
<DT id="1398"><B>-r</B><DD>


Produce a relocatable object as output.  This is also known as partial
linking.
<DT id="1399"><B>-rdynamic</B><DD>


Pass the flag <B>-export-dynamic</B> to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of <TT>&quot;dlopen&quot;</TT> or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.
<DT id="1400"><B>-s</B><DD>


Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
<DT id="1401"><B>-static</B><DD>


On systems that support dynamic linking, this overrides <B>-pie</B>
and prevents linking with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this
option has no effect.
<DT id="1402"><B>-shared</B><DD>


Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation
(<B>-fpic</B>, <B>-fPIC</B>, or model suboptions) when
you specify this linker option.[1]
<DT id="1403"><B>-shared-libgcc</B><DD>



<DT id="1404"><B>-static-libgcc</B><DD>



On systems that provide <I>libgcc</I> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
If no shared version of <I>libgcc</I> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.


<P>


There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared <I>libgcc</I> instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared <I>libgcc</I>.


<P>


Therefore, the G++ driver automatically adds <B>-shared-libgcc</B>
whenever you build a shared library or a main executable, because C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
programs typically use exceptions, so this is the right thing to do.


<P>


If, instead, you use the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared <I>libgcc</I>.
If <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker that does not support option <B>--eh-frame-hdr</B>,
it links the shared version of <I>libgcc</I> into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of <I>libgcc</I>, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.


<P>


However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ driver, or using the option
<B>-shared-libgcc</B>, such that it is linked with the shared
<I>libgcc</I>.
<DT id="1405"><B>-static-libasan</B><DD>


When the <B>-fsanitize=address</B> option is used to link a program,
the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver automatically links against <B>libasan</B>.  If
<I>libasan</I> is available as a shared library, and the <B>-static</B>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<I>libasan</I>.  The <B>-static-libasan</B> option directs the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
driver to link <I>libasan</I> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
<DT id="1406"><B>-static-libtsan</B><DD>


When the <B>-fsanitize=thread</B> option is used to link a program,
the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver automatically links against <B>libtsan</B>.  If
<I>libtsan</I> is available as a shared library, and the <B>-static</B>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<I>libtsan</I>.  The <B>-static-libtsan</B> option directs the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
driver to link <I>libtsan</I> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
<DT id="1407"><B>-static-liblsan</B><DD>


When the <B>-fsanitize=leak</B> option is used to link a program,
the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver automatically links against <B>liblsan</B>.  If
<I>liblsan</I> is available as a shared library, and the <B>-static</B>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<I>liblsan</I>.  The <B>-static-liblsan</B> option directs the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
driver to link <I>liblsan</I> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
<DT id="1408"><B>-static-libubsan</B><DD>


When the <B>-fsanitize=undefined</B> option is used to link a program,
the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver automatically links against <B>libubsan</B>.  If
<I>libubsan</I> is available as a shared library, and the <B>-static</B>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<I>libubsan</I>.  The <B>-static-libubsan</B> option directs the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
driver to link <I>libubsan</I> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
<DT id="1409"><B>-static-libstdc++</B><DD>


When the <B>g++</B> program is used to link a C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> program, it
normally automatically links against <B>libstdc++</B>.  If
<I>libstdc++</I> is available as a shared library, and the
<B>-static</B> option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of <I>libstdc++</I>.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of <I>libstdc++</I> used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
<B>-static-libstdc++</B> option directs the <B>g++</B> driver to
link <I>libstdc++</I> statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.
<DT id="1410"><B>-symbolic</B><DD>


Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option <B>-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs</B>).  Only a few systems support
this option.
<DT id="1411"><B>-T</B> <I>script</I><DD>


Use <I>script</I> as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the <B>-T</B> option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.
<DT id="1412"><B>-Xlinker</B> <I>option</I><DD>


Pass <I>option</I> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not recognize.


<P>


If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
<B>-Xlinker</B> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass <B>-assert definitions</B>, you must write
<B>-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</B>.  It does not work to write
<B>-Xlinker ``-assert definitions''</B>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.


<P>


When using the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the <I>option</I><B>=</B><I>value</I>
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
<B>-Xlinker -Map=output.map</B> rather than
<B>-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map</B>.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.
<DT id="1413"><B>-Wl,</B><I>option</I><DD>


Pass <I>option</I> as an option to the linker.  If <I>option</I> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, <B>-Wl,-Map,output.map</B> passes <B>-Map output.map</B> to the
linker.  When using the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker, you can also get the same effect with
<B>-Wl,-Map=output.map</B>.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> In Ubuntu 8.10 and later versions, for <FONT SIZE="-1">LDFLAGS,</FONT> the option
<B>-Wl,-z,relro</B> is used.  To disable, use <B>-Wl,-z,norelro</B>.
<DT id="1414"><B>-u</B> <I>symbol</I><DD>


Pretend the symbol <I>symbol</I> is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use <B>-u</B> multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
<DT id="1415"><B>-z</B> <I>keyword</I><DD>


<B>-z</B> is passed directly on to the linker along with the keyword
<I>keyword</I>. See the section in the documentation of your linker for
permitted values and their meanings.

<H3>Options for Directory Search</H3>



These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1416"><B>-I</B> <I>dir</I><DD>



<DT id="1417"><B>-iquote</B> <I>dir</I><DD>


<DT id="1418"><B>-isystem</B> <I>dir</I><DD>


<DT id="1419"><B>-idirafter</B> <I>dir</I><DD>



Add the directory <I>dir</I> to the list of directories to be searched
for header files during preprocessing.
If <I>dir</I> begins with <B>=</B> or <TT>$SYSROOT</TT>, then the <B>=</B>
or <TT>$SYSROOT</TT> is replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
<B>--sysroot</B> and <B>-isysroot</B>.


<P>


Directories specified with <B>-iquote</B> apply only to the quote 
form of the directive, <TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&quot;</TT>file<TT>&quot;&quot;</TT>.
Directories specified with <B>-I</B>, <B>-isystem</B>, 
or <B>-idirafter</B> apply to lookup for both the
<TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&quot;</TT>file<TT>&quot;&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&lt;</TT>file<TT>&gt;&quot;</TT> directives.


<P>


You can specify any number or combination of these options on the 
command line to search for header files in several directories.  
The lookup order is as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1420"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1421">1.<DD>


For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the current
file is searched first.
<DT id="1422">2.<DD>


For the quote form of the include directive, the directories specified
by <B>-iquote</B> options are searched in left-to-right order,
as they appear on the command line.
<DT id="1423">3.<DD>


Directories specified with <B>-I</B> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.
<DT id="1424">4.<DD>


Directories specified with <B>-isystem</B> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.
<DT id="1425">5.<DD>


Standard system directories are scanned.
<DT id="1426">6.<DD>


Directories specified with <B>-idirafter</B> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1427"><DD>


<P>


You can use <B>-I</B> to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the standard system header file directories.  
However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files; use <B>-isystem</B> for that.


<P>


The <B>-isystem</B> and <B>-idirafter</B> options also mark the directory
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment that
is applied to the standard system directories.


<P>


If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<B>-isystem</B>, is also specified with <B>-I</B>, the <B>-I</B>
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the <TT>&quot;#include_next&quot;</TT> directive are not inadvertently
changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the <B>-nostdinc</B> and/or <B>-isystem</B> options.
</DL>

<DT id="1428"><B>-I-</B><DD>


Split the include path.
This option has been deprecated.  Please use <B>-iquote</B> instead for
<B>-I</B> directories before the <B>-I-</B> and remove the <B>-I-</B>
option.


<P>


Any directories specified with <B>-I</B>
options before <B>-I-</B> are searched only for headers requested with
<TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&quot;</TT>file<TT>&quot;&quot;</TT>; they are not searched for
<TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&lt;</TT>file<TT>&gt;&quot;</TT>.  If additional directories are
specified with <B>-I</B> options after the <B>-I-</B>, those
directories are searched for all <B>#include</B> directives.


<P>


In addition, <B>-I-</B> inhibits the use of the directory of the current
file directory as the first search directory for <TT>&quot;#include&nbsp;&quot;</TT>file<TT>&quot;&quot;</TT>.  There is no way to override this effect of <B>-I-</B>.
<DT id="1429"><B>-iprefix</B> <I>prefix</I><DD>


Specify <I>prefix</I> as the prefix for subsequent <B>-iwithprefix</B>
options.  If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the
final <B>/</B>.
<DT id="1430"><B>-iwithprefix</B> <I>dir</I><DD>



<DT id="1431"><B>-iwithprefixbefore</B> <I>dir</I><DD>



Append <I>dir</I> to the prefix specified previously with
<B>-iprefix</B>, and add the resulting directory to the include search
path.  <B>-iwithprefixbefore</B> puts it in the same place <B>-I</B>
would; <B>-iwithprefix</B> puts it where <B>-idirafter</B> would.
<DT id="1432"><B>-isysroot</B> <I>dir</I><DD>


This option is like the <B>--sysroot</B> option, but applies only to
header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both header
files and libraries).  See the <B>--sysroot</B> option for more
information.
<DT id="1433"><B>-imultilib</B> <I>dir</I><DD>


Use <I>dir</I> as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> headers.
<DT id="1434"><B>-nostdinc</B><DD>


Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
Only the directories explicitly specified with <B>-I</B>,
<B>-iquote</B>, <B>-isystem</B>, and/or <B>-idirafter</B>
options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) 
are searched.
<DT id="1435"><B>-nostdinc++</B><DD>


Do not search for header files in the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option is
used when building the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> library.)
<DT id="1436"><B>-iplugindir=</B><I>dir</I><DD>


Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed
by <B>-fplugin=</B><I>name</I> instead of
<B>-fplugin=</B><I>path</I><B>/</B><I>name</I><B>.so</B>.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.
<DT id="1437"><B>-L</B><I>dir</I><DD>


Add directory <I>dir</I> to the list of directories to be searched
for <B>-l</B>.
<DT id="1438"><B>-B</B><I>prefix</I><DD>


This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.


<P>


The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<B>cpp</B>, <B>cc1</B>, <B>as</B> and <B>ld</B>.  It tries
<I>prefix</I> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without <I>machine</I><B>/</B><I>version</I><B>/</B> for the corresponding target
machine and compiler version.


<P>


For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<B>-B</B> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <B>-B</B>
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, 
<I>/usr/lib/gcc/</I> and <I>/usr/local/lib/gcc/</I>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable.


<P>


The compiler checks to see if the path provided by <B>-B</B>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.


<P>


<B>-B</B> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <B>-L</B> options for the linker.  They also apply to
include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into <B>-isystem</B> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends <B>include</B> to the prefix.


<P>


The runtime support file <I>libgcc.a</I> can also be searched for using
the <B>-B</B> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.


<P>


Another way to specify a prefix much like the <B>-B</B> prefix is to use
the environment variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.


<P>


As a special kludge, if the path provided by <B>-B</B> is
<I>[dir/]stageN/</I>, where <I>N</I> is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by <I>[dir/]include</I>.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
<DT id="1439"><B>-no-canonical-prefixes</B><DD>


Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to <B>/../</B>
or <B>/./</B>, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.
<DT id="1440"><B>--sysroot=</B><I>dir</I><DD>


Use <I>dir</I> as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
<I>/usr/include</I> and libraries in <I>/usr/lib</I>, it instead
searches <I>dir/usr/include</I> and <I>dir/usr/lib</I>.


<P>


If you use both this option and the <B>-isysroot</B> option, then
the <B>--sysroot</B> option applies to libraries, but the
<B>-isysroot</B> option applies to header files.


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of <B>--sysroot</B> still works, but the
library aspect does not.
<DT id="1441"><B>--no-sysroot-suffix</B><DD>


For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with <B>--sysroot</B>, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
<I>dir/suffix/usr/include</I> instead of
<I>dir/usr/include</I>.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.

<H3>Options for Code Generation Conventions</H3>



These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.
<P>

Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <B>-ffoo</B> is <B>-fno-foo</B>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed---the one that is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <B>no-</B> or adding
it.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1442"><B>-fstack-reuse=</B><I>reuse-level</I><DD>


This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  <I>reuse_level</I> can be <B>all</B>,
<B>named_vars</B>, or <B>none</B>. <B>all</B> enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, <B>named_vars</B> enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and <B>none</B> disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is <B>all</B>. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime is likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.


<P>


For example,


<P>




<PRE>
           int *p;
           {
             int local1;
        
             p = &amp;local1;
             local1 = 10;
             ....
           }
           {
              int local2;
              local2 = 20;
              ...
           }
        
           if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
             {
        
             }

</PRE>




<P>


Another example:


<P>




<PRE>
           struct A
           {
               A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }
               int i;
               int j;
           };
        
           A *ap;
        
           void foo(const A&amp; ar)
           {
              ap = &amp;ar;
           }
        
           void bar()
           {
              foo(A(10)); // temp object's lifetime ends when foo returns
        
              {
                A a(20);
                ....
              }
              ap-&gt;i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
                           // is reused with a. What is the value of ap-&gt;i?
           }

</PRE>




<P>


The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries' stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.
<DT id="1443"><B>-ftrapv</B><DD>


This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
The options <B>-ftrapv</B> and <B>-fwrapv</B> override each other, so using
<B>-ftrapv</B> <B>-fwrapv</B> on the command-line results in
<B>-fwrapv</B> being effective.  Note that only active options override, so
using <B>-ftrapv</B> <B>-fwrapv</B> <B>-fno-wrapv</B> on the command-line
results in <B>-ftrapv</B> being effective.
<DT id="1444"><B>-fwrapv</B><DD>


This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.
The options <B>-ftrapv</B> and <B>-fwrapv</B> override each other, so using
<B>-ftrapv</B> <B>-fwrapv</B> on the command-line results in
<B>-fwrapv</B> being effective.  Note that only active options override, so
using <B>-ftrapv</B> <B>-fwrapv</B> <B>-fno-wrapv</B> on the command-line
results in <B>-ftrapv</B> being effective.
<DT id="1445"><B>-fwrapv-pointer</B><DD>


This option instructs the compiler to assume that pointer arithmetic
overflow on addition and subtraction wraps around using twos-complement
representation.  This flag disables some optimizations which assume
pointer overflow is invalid.
<DT id="1446"><B>-fstrict-overflow</B><DD>


This option implies <B>-fno-wrapv</B> <B>-fno-wrapv-pointer</B> and when
negated implies <B>-fwrapv</B> <B>-fwrapv-pointer</B>.
<DT id="1447"><B>-fexceptions</B><DD>


Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> enables it by default for languages like
C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> programs that don't
use exception handling.
<DT id="1448"><B>-fnon-call-exceptions</B><DD>


Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <I>trapping</I>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as <TT>&quot;SIGALRM&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="1449"><B>-fdelete-dead-exceptions</B><DD>


Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise
contribute to the execution of the program can be optimized away.
This option is enabled by default for the Ada front end, as permitted by
the Ada language specification.
Optimization passes that cause dead exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
<DT id="1450"><B>-funwind-tables</B><DD>


Similar to <B>-fexceptions</B>, except that it just generates any needed
static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other way.
You normally do not need to enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.
<DT id="1451"><B>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</B><DD>


Generate unwind table in <FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
<DT id="1452"><B>-fno-gnu-unique</B><DD>


On systems with recent <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> assembler and C library, the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> compiler
uses the <TT>&quot;STB_GNU_UNIQUE&quot;</TT> binding to make sure that definitions
of template static data members and static local variables in inline
functions are unique even in the presence of <TT>&quot;RTLD_LOCAL&quot;</TT>; this
is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two different
<TT>&quot;RTLD_LOCAL&quot;</TT> plugins depending on a definition in one of them and
therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of the
symbol.  But this causes <TT>&quot;dlclose&quot;</TT> to be ignored for affected
DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO</FONT> via
<TT>&quot;dlclose&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;dlopen&quot;</TT>, you can use
<B>-fno-gnu-unique</B>.
<DT id="1453"><B>-fpcc-struct-return</B><DD>


Return ``short'' <TT>&quot;struct&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;union&quot;</TT> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).


<P>


The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.


<P>


Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> code compiled with the <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<B>-freg-struct-return</B> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT id="1454"><B>-freg-struct-return</B><DD>


Return <TT>&quot;struct&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;union&quot;</TT> values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
<B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>.


<P>


If you specify neither <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B> nor
<B>-freg-struct-return</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
defaults to <B>-fpcc-struct-return</B>, except on targets where <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> code compiled with the <B>-freg-struct-return</B>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<B>-fpcc-struct-return</B> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT id="1455"><B>-fshort-enums</B><DD>


Allocate to an <TT>&quot;enum&quot;</TT> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <TT>&quot;enum&quot;</TT> type
is equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough room.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fshort-enums</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT id="1456"><B>-fshort-wchar</B><DD>


Override the underlying type for <TT>&quot;wchar_t&quot;</TT> to be <TT>&quot;short
unsigned int&quot;</TT> instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under <FONT SIZE="-1">WINE.</FONT>


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fshort-wchar</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT id="1457"><B>-fno-common</B><DD>


In C code, this option controls the placement of global variables 
defined without an initializer, known as <I>tentative definitions</I> 
in the C standard.  Tentative definitions are distinct from declarations 
of a variable with the <TT>&quot;extern&quot;</TT> keyword, which do not allocate storage.


<P>


Unix C compilers have traditionally allocated storage for
uninitialized global variables in a common block.  This allows the
linker to resolve all tentative definitions of the same variable
in different compilation units to the same object, or to a non-tentative
definition.  
This is the behavior specified by <B>-fcommon</B>, and is the default for 
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> on most targets.  
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO
C,</FONT> and on some targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on
variable references.


<P>


The <B>-fno-common</B> option specifies that the compiler should instead
place uninitialized global variables in the <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> section of the object file.
This inhibits the merging of tentative definitions by the linker so
you get a multiple-definition error if the same 
variable is defined in more than one compilation unit.
Compiling with <B>-fno-common</B> is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable definitions this way.
<DT id="1458"><B>-fno-ident</B><DD>


Ignore the <TT>&quot;#ident&quot;</TT> directive.
<DT id="1459"><B>-finhibit-size-directive</B><DD>


Don't output a <TT>&quot;.size&quot;</TT> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <I>crtstuff.c</I>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
<DT id="1460"><B>-fverbose-asm</B><DD>


Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).


<P>


<B>-fno-verbose-asm</B>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.


<P>

</DL>

<DT id="1466"><B>-frecord-gcc-switches</B><DD>


This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> text.  This
switch is related to the <B>-fverbose-asm</B> switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
See also <B>-grecord-gcc-switches</B> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
<DT id="1467"><B>-fpic</B><DD>


Generate position-independent code (<FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT>) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (<FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT>).  The dynamic
loader resolves the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>; it is part of the operating system).  If
the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<B>-fpic</B> does not work; in that case, recompile with <B>-fPIC</B>
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC,</FONT> 28k on AArch64 and 32k
on the m68k and <FONT SIZE="-1">RS/6000.</FONT>  The x86 has no such limit.)


<P>


Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the x86, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM RS/6000</FONT> is always
position-independent.


<P>


When this flag is set, the macros <TT>&quot;__pic__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__PIC__&quot;</TT>
are defined to 1.
<DT id="1468"><B>-fPIC</B><DD>


If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on AArch64, m68k,
PowerPC and <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC.</FONT>


<P>


Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.


<P>


When this flag is set, the macros <TT>&quot;__pic__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__PIC__&quot;</TT>

<DT id="1469"><B>-fpie</B><DD>



<DT id="1470"><B>-fPIE</B><DD>



These options are similar to <B>-fpic</B> and <B>-fPIC</B>, but the
generated position-independent code can be only linked into executables.
Usually these options are used to compile code that will be linked using
the <B>-pie</B> <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> option.


<P>


<B>-fpie</B> and <B>-fPIE</B> both define the macros
<TT>&quot;__pie__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;__PIE__&quot;</TT>.  The macros have the value 1
for <B>-fpie</B> and 2 for <B>-fPIE</B>.
<DT id="1471"><B>-fno-plt</B><DD>


Do not use the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> for external function calls in position-independent code.
Instead, load the callee address at call sites from the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> and branch to it.
This leads to more efficient code by eliminating <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> stubs and exposing
<FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> loads to optimizations.  On architectures such as 32-bit x86 where
<FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> stubs expect the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> pointer in a specific register, this gives more
register allocation freedom to the compiler.
Lazy binding requires use of the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT>; 
with <B>-fno-plt</B> all external symbols are resolved at load time.


<P>


Alternatively, the function attribute <TT>&quot;noplt&quot;</TT> can be used to avoid calls
through the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> for specific external functions.


<P>


In position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to
functions that are marked to not use the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> to use the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> instead.
<DT id="1472"><B>-fno-jump-tables</B><DD>


Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with <B>-fpic</B> or <B>-fPIC</B> for
building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> and this option is not needed.
<DT id="1473"><B>-ffixed-</B><I>reg</I><DD>


Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).


<P>


<I>reg</I> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <TT>&quot;REGISTER_NAMES&quot;</TT>
macro in the machine description macro file.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT id="1474"><B>-fcall-used-</B><I>reg</I><DD>


Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
do not save and restore the register <I>reg</I>.


<P>


It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT id="1475"><B>-fcall-saved-</B><I>reg</I><DD>


Treat the register named <I>reg</I> as an allocable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way save and restore
the register <I>reg</I> if they use it.


<P>


It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.


<P>


A different sort of disaster results from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.


<P>


This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
<DT id="1476"><B>-fpack-struct[=</B><I>n</I><B>]</B><DD>


Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this are output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fpack-struct</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
<DT id="1477"><B>-fleading-underscore</B><DD>


This option and its counterpart, <B>-fno-leading-underscore</B>, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the <B>-fleading-underscore</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.
<DT id="1478"><B>-ftls-model=</B><I>model</I><DD>


Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The <I>model</I> argument should be one of <B>global-dynamic</B>,
<B>local-dynamic</B>, <B>initial-exec</B> or <B>local-exec</B>.
Note that the choice is subject to optimization: the compiler may use
a more efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the translation
unit, or if <B>-fpic</B> is not given on the command line.


<P>


The default without <B>-fpic</B> is <B>initial-exec</B>; with
<B>-fpic</B> the default is <B>global-dynamic</B>.
<DT id="1479"><B>-ftrampolines</B><DD>


For targets that normally need trampolines for nested functions, always
generate them instead of using descriptors.  Otherwise, for targets that
do not need them, like for example HP-PA or <FONT SIZE="-1">IA-64,</FONT> do nothing.


<P>


A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run time on the
stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is used to call
the nested function indirectly.  Therefore, it requires the stack to be
made executable in order for the program to work properly.


<P>


<B>-fno-trampolines</B> is enabled by default on a language by language
basis to let the compiler avoid generating them, if it computes that this
is safe, and replace them with descriptors.  Descriptors are made up of data
only, but the generated code must be prepared to deal with them.  As of this
writing, <B>-fno-trampolines</B> is enabled by default only for Ada.


<P>


Moreover, code compiled with <B>-ftrampolines</B> and code compiled with
<B>-fno-trampolines</B> are not binary compatible if nested functions are
present.  This option must therefore be used on a program-wide basis and be
manipulated with extreme care.
<DT id="1480"><B>-fvisibility=</B>[<B>default</B>|<B>internal</B>|<B>hidden</B>|<B>protected</B>]<DD>


Set the default <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> image symbol visibility to the specified option---all
symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is <B>strongly</B> recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.


<P>


Despite the nomenclature, <B>default</B> always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
<B>protected</B> and <B>internal</B> are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option is <B>hidden</B>.
The default if <B>-fvisibility</B> isn't specified is
<B>default</B>, i.e., make every symbol public.


<P>


A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT>
symbols have the correct visibility is given by ``How To Write
Shared Libraries'' by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
&lt;<B><A HREF="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/">https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/</A></B>&gt;)---however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with <B>-fvisibility=hidden</B>
and <TT>&quot;__attribute__ ((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))&quot;</TT> instead of
<TT>&quot;__declspec(dllexport)&quot;</TT> you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.


<P>


For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
<TT>&quot;#pragma GCC visibility&quot;</TT> of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
<TT>&quot;#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;#pragma GCC visibility pop&quot;</TT>.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed <B>as
part of the </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>API</B></FONT><B> interface contract</B> and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local <FONT SIZE="-1">DSO</FONT> should <B>always</B> be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> indirection overheads---making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT></FONT> specification requirements, <TT>&quot;operator new&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;operator delete&quot;</TT> must always be of default visibility.


<P>


Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say <TT>&quot;#pragma GCC visibility push(default)&quot;</TT>
before including any such headers.


<P>


<TT>&quot;extern&quot;</TT> declarations are not affected by <B>-fvisibility</B>, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with <B>-fvisibility=hidden</B> with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to <TT>&quot;extern&quot;</TT>
functions with no explicit visibility use the <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT,</FONT> so it is more
effective to use <TT>&quot;__attribute ((visibility))&quot;</TT> and/or
<TT>&quot;#pragma GCC visibility&quot;</TT> to tell the compiler which <TT>&quot;extern&quot;</TT>
declarations should be treated as hidden.


<P>


Note that <B>-fvisibility</B> does affect C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the <B>type_info</B> nodes are unified between
the DSOs.


<P>


An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at &lt;<B><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</A></B>&gt;.
<DT id="1481"><B>-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</B><DD>


This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as <TT>&quot;unsigned short&quot;</TT> (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use 16-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.


<P>


If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.


<P>


In some cases, such as when the <TT>&quot;packed&quot;</TT> attribute is applied to a 
structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single
read or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine.  In this
case <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code that 
will fault or truncate the result at run time.


<P>


Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 memory model, write accesses are
not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended
to define all bits of the field's type as bit-field members.


<P>


The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.
<DT id="1482"><B>-fsync-libcalls</B><DD>


This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the <TT>&quot;__sync&quot;</TT>
family of functions may be used to implement the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>11 <TT>&quot;__atomic&quot;</TT>
family of functions.


<P>


The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is <B>-fno-sync-libcalls</B>.  This option is used in
the implementation of the <I>libatomic</I> runtime library.

<H3><FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> Developer Options</H3>



This section describes command-line options that are primarily of
interest to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> developers, including options to support compiler
testing and investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time
performance problems.  This includes options that produce debug dumps
at various points in the compilation; that print statistics such as
memory use and execution time; and that print information about <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s
configuration, such as where it searches for libraries.  You should
rarely need to use any of these options for ordinary compilation and
linking tasks.
<P>

Many developer options that cause <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to dump output to a file take an
optional <B>=</B><I>filename</I> suffix. You can specify <B>stdout</B>
or <B>-</B> to dump to standard output, and <B>stderr</B> for standard
error.
<P>

If <B>=</B><I>filename</I> is omitted, a default dump file name is
constructed by concatenating the base dump file name, a pass number,
phase letter, and pass name.  The base dump file name is the name of
output file produced by the compiler if explicitly specified and not
an executable; otherwise it is the source file name.
The pass number is determined by the order passes are registered with
the compiler's pass manager. 
This is generally the same as the order of execution, but passes
registered by plugins, target-specific passes, or passes that are
otherwise registered late are numbered higher than the pass named
<B>final</B>, even if they are executed earlier.  The phase letter is
one of <B>i</B> (inter-procedural analysis), <B>l</B>
(language-specific), <B>r</B> (<FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT>), or <B>t</B> (tree). 
The files are created in the directory of the output file.

and <I>filename</I> portions behave as described in the
<B>-fdump-tree</B> option.  The following <I>switch</I> values are
accepted:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1579"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1580"><B>all</B><DD>


Enable all language-specific dumps.
<DT id="1581"><B>class</B><DD>


Dump class hierarchy information.  Virtual table information is emitted
unless '<B>slim</B>' is specified.  This option is applicable to C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only.
<DT id="1582"><B>raw</B><DD>


Dump the raw internal tree data.  This option is applicable to C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> only.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1583"><DD>
</DL>

<DT id="1584"><B>-fdump-passes</B><DD>


Print on <I>stderr</I> the list of optimization passes that are turned
on and off by the current command-line options.
<DT id="1585"><B>-fdump-statistics-</B><I>option</I><DD>


Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate file.  The
file name is generated by appending a suffix ending in
<B>.statistics</B> to the source file name, and the file is created in
the same directory as the output file.  If the <B>-</B><I>option</I>
form is used, <B>-stats</B> causes counters to be summed over the
whole compilation unit while <B>-details</B> dumps every event as
the passes generate them.  The default with no option is to sum
counters for each function compiled.
<DT id="1586"><B>-fdump-tree-all</B><DD>



<DT id="1587"><B>-fdump-tree-</B><I>switch</I><DD>


<DT id="1588"><B>-fdump-tree-</B><I>switch</I><B>-</B><I>options</I><DD>


<DT id="1589"><B>-fdump-tree-</B><I>switch</I><B>-</B><I>options</I><B>=</B><I>filename</I><DD>



Control the dumping at various stages of processing the intermediate
language tree to a file.  If the <B>-</B><I>options</I>
form is used, <I>options</I> is a list of <B>-</B> separated options
which control the details of the dump.  Not all options are applicable
to all dumps; those that are not meaningful are ignored.  The
following options are available
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1590"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1591"><B>address</B><DD>


Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not meaningful as it
changes according to the environment and source file.  Its primary use
is for tying up a dump file with a debug environment.
<DT id="1592"><B>asmname</B><DD>


If <TT>&quot;DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME&quot;</TT> has been set for a given decl, use that
in the dump instead of <TT>&quot;DECL_NAME&quot;</TT>.  Its primary use is ease of
use working backward from mangled names in the assembly file.
<DT id="1593"><B>slim</B><DD>


When dumping front-end intermediate representations, inhibit dumping
of members of a scope or body of a function merely because that scope
has been reached.  Only dump such items when they are directly reachable
by some other path.


<P>


When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option inhibits dumping the
bodies of control structures.


<P>


When dumping <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL,</FONT> print the <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> in slim (condensed) form instead of
the default LISP-like representation.
<DT id="1594"><B>raw</B><DD>


Print a raw representation of the tree.  By default, trees are
pretty-printed into a C-like representation.
<DT id="1595"><B>details</B><DD>


Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump option). Also
include information from the optimization passes.
<DT id="1596"><B>stats</B><DD>


Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not honored by every dump
option).
<DT id="1597"><B>blocks</B><DD>


Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw dumps).
<DT id="1598"><B>graph</B><DD>


For each of the other indicated dump files (<B>-fdump-rtl-</B><I>pass</I>),
dump a representation of the control flow graph suitable for viewing with
GraphViz to <I>file.passid.pass.dot</I>.  Each function in
the file is pretty-printed as a subgraph, so that GraphViz can render them
all in a single plot.


<P>


This option currently only works for <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> dumps, and the <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> is always
dumped in slim form.
<DT id="1599"><B>vops</B><DD>


Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.
<DT id="1600"><B>lineno</B><DD>


Enable showing line numbers for statements.
<DT id="1601"><B>uid</B><DD>


Enable showing the unique <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> (<TT>&quot;DECL_UID&quot;</TT>) for each variable.
<DT id="1602"><B>verbose</B><DD>


Enable showing the tree dump for each statement.
<DT id="1603"><B>eh</B><DD>


Enable showing the <FONT SIZE="-1">EH</FONT> region number holding each statement.
<DT id="1604"><B>scev</B><DD>


Enable showing scalar evolution analysis details.
<DT id="1605"><B>optimized</B><DD>


Enable showing optimization information (only available in certain
passes).
<DT id="1606"><B>missed</B><DD>


Enable showing missed optimization information (only available in certain
passes).
<DT id="1607"><B>note</B><DD>


Enable other detailed optimization information (only available in
certain passes).
<DT id="1608"><B>all</B><DD>


Turn on all options, except <B>raw</B>, <B>slim</B>, <B>verbose</B>
and <B>lineno</B>.
<DT id="1609"><B>optall</B><DD>


Turn on all optimization options, i.e., <B>optimized</B>,
<B>missed</B>, and <B>note</B>.

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1610"><DD>


<P>


To determine what tree dumps are available or find the dump for a pass
of interest follow the steps below.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1611">1.<DD>


Invoke <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with <B>-fdump-passes</B> and in the <I>stderr</I> output
look for a code that corresponds to the pass you are interested in.
For example, the codes <TT>&quot;tree-evrp&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;tree-vrp1&quot;</TT>, and
<TT>&quot;tree-vrp2&quot;</TT> correspond to the three Value Range Propagation passes.
The number at the end distinguishes distinct invocations of the same pass.
<DT id="1612">2.<DD>


To enable the creation of the dump file, append the pass code to
the <B>-fdump-</B> option prefix and invoke <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with it.  For example,
to enable the dump from the Early Value Range Propagation pass, invoke
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with the <B>-fdump-tree-evrp</B> option.  Optionally, you may
specify the name of the dump file.  If you don't specify one, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
creates as described below.
<DT id="1613">3.<DD>


Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of three components
separated by a period: the name of the source file <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was invoked to
compile, a numeric suffix indicating the pass number followed by the
letter <B>t</B> for tree passes (and the letter <B>r</B> for <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> passes),
and finally the pass code.  For example, the Early <FONT SIZE="-1">VRP</FONT> pass dump might
be in a file named <I>myfile.c.038t.evrp</I> in the current working
directory.  Note that the numeric codes are not stable and may change
from one version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to another.

<DT id="1617"><B>-fopt-info-</B><I>options</I><B>=</B><I>filename</I><DD>



Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the
<B>-</B><I>options</I> form is used, <I>options</I> is a list of
<B>-</B> separated option keywords to select the dump details and
optimizations.


<P>


The <I>options</I> can be divided into three groups:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1618"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1619">1.<DD>


options describing what kinds of messages should be emitted,
<DT id="1620">2.<DD>


options describing the verbosity of the dump, and
<DT id="1621">3.<DD>


options describing which optimizations should be included.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1622"><DD>


<P>


The options from each group can be freely mixed as they are
non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts,
the later options override the earlier options on the command
line.


<P>


The following options control which kinds of messages should be emitted:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1623"><B>optimized</B><DD>


Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is
up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the
vectorizer passes print the source location of loops which are
successfully vectorized.
<DT id="1624"><B>missed</B><DD>


Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes
control which information to include in the output.
<DT id="1625"><B>note</B><DD>


Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain
transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc.
<DT id="1626"><B>all</B><DD>


Print detailed optimization information. This includes
<B>optimized</B>, <B>missed</B>, and <B>note</B>.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1627"><DD>


<P>


The following option controls the dump verbosity:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1628"><B>internals</B><DD>


By default, only ``high-level'' messages are emitted. This option enables
additional, more detailed, messages, which are likely to only be of interest
to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> developers.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1629"><DD>


<P>


One or more of the following option keywords can be used to describe a
group of optimizations:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1630"><B>ipa</B><DD>


Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations.
<DT id="1631"><B>loop</B><DD>


Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.
<DT id="1632"><B>inline</B><DD>


Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.
<DT id="1633"><B>omp</B><DD>


Enable dumps from all <FONT SIZE="-1">OMP</FONT> (Offloading and Multi Processing) optimizations.
<DT id="1634"><B>vec</B><DD>


Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations.
<DT id="1635"><B>optall</B><DD>


Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset of
the optimization groups listed above.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1636"><DD>


<P>


If <I>options</I> is
omitted, it defaults to <B>optimized-optall</B>, which means to dump messages
about successful optimizations from all the passes, omitting messages
that are treated as ``internals''.


<P>


If the <I>filename</I> is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the <I>filename</I>.
Otherwise the dump is output onto <I>stderr</I>. Though multiple
<B>-fopt-info</B> options are accepted, only one of them can include
a <I>filename</I>. If other filenames are provided then all but the
first such option are ignored.


<P>


Note that the output <I>filename</I> is overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, <I>stderr</I> should be used
instead.


<P>


In the following example, the optimization info is output to
<I>stderr</I>:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -O3 -fopt-info

</PRE>




<P>


This example:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all

</PRE>




<P>


outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
<I>missed.all</I>, and this one:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed

</PRE>




<P>


prints information about missed optimization opportunities from
vectorization passes on <I>stderr</I>.  
Note that <B>-fopt-info-vec-missed</B> is equivalent to 
<B>-fopt-info-missed-vec</B>.  The order of the optimization group
names and message types listed after <B>-fopt-info</B> does not matter.


<P>


As another example,


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt

</PRE>




<P>


outputs information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
<I>inline.txt</I>.


<P>


Finally, consider:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt

</PRE>




<P>


Here the two output filenames <I>vec.miss</I> and <I>loop.opt</I> are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only <I>vec.miss</I> is produced which contains
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.
</DL>

<DT id="1637"><B>-fsave-optimization-record</B><DD>


Write a <FONT SIZE="-1">SRCFILE</FONT>.opt-record.json.gz file detailing what optimizations
were performed, for those optimizations that support <B>-fopt-info</B>.


<P>


This option is experimental and the format of the data within the
compressed <FONT SIZE="-1">JSON</FONT> file is subject to change.


<P>


It is roughly equivalent to a machine-readable version of
<B>-fopt-info-all</B>, as a collection of messages with source file,
line number and column number, with the following additional data for
each message:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1638"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1639">*<DD>
the execution count of the code being optimized, along with metadata about
whether this was from actual profile data, or just an estimate, allowing
consumers to prioritize messages by code hotness,
<DT id="1640">*<DD>
the function name of the code being optimized, where applicable,
<DT id="1641">*<DD>
the ``inlining chain'' for the code being optimized, so that when
a function is inlined into several different places (which might
themselves be inlined), the reader can distinguish between the copies,
<DT id="1642">*<DD>
objects identifying those parts of the message that refer to expressions,
statements or symbol-table nodes, which of these categories they are, and,
when available, their source code location,
<DT id="1643">*<DD>
the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> pass that emitted the message, and
<DT id="1644">*<DD>
the location in <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s own code from which the message was emitted
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1645"><DD>


<P>


Additionally, some messages are logically nested within other
messages, reflecting implementation details of the optimization
passes.
</DL>

<DT id="1646"><B>-fsched-verbose=</B><I>n</I><DD>


On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints to the dump files.


<P>


For <I>n</I> greater than zero, <B>-fsched-verbose</B> outputs the
same information as <B>-fdump-rtl-sched1</B> and <B>-fdump-rtl-sched2</B>.
For <I>n</I> greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For <I>n</I> greater
than two, it includes <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> at abort point, control-flow and regions info.
And for <I>n</I> over four, <B>-fsched-verbose</B> also includes
dependence info.
<DT id="1647"><B>-fenable-</B><I>kind</I><B>-</B><I>pass</I><DD>



<DT id="1648"><B>-fdisable-</B><I>kind</I><B>-</B><I>pass</I><B>=</B><I>range-list</I><DD>



This is a set of options that are used to explicitly disable/enable
optimization passes.  These options are intended for use for debugging <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
Compiler users should use regular options for enabling/disabling
passes instead.
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1649"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1650"><B>-fdisable-ipa-</B><I>pass</I><DD>


Disable <FONT SIZE="-1">IPA</FONT> pass <I>pass</I>. <I>pass</I> is the pass name.  If the same pass is
statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the pass name should be
appended with a sequential number starting from 1.
<DT id="1651"><B>-fdisable-rtl-</B><I>pass</I><DD>



<DT id="1652"><B>-fdisable-rtl-</B><I>pass</I><B>=</B><I>range-list</I><DD>



Disable <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> pass <I>pass</I>.  <I>pass</I> is the pass name.  If the same pass is
statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the pass name should be
appended with a sequential number starting from 1.  <I>range-list</I> is a 
comma-separated list of function ranges or assembler names.  Each range is a number
pair separated by a colon.  The range is inclusive in both ends.  If the range
is trivial, the number pair can be simplified as a single number.  If the
function's call graph node's <I>uid</I> falls within one of the specified ranges,
the <I>pass</I> is disabled for that function.  The <I>uid</I> is shown in the
function header of a dump file, and the pass names can be dumped by using
option <B>-fdump-passes</B>.
<DT id="1653"><B>-fdisable-tree-</B><I>pass</I><DD>



<DT id="1654"><B>-fdisable-tree-</B><I>pass</I><B>=</B><I>range-list</I><DD>



Disable tree pass <I>pass</I>.  See <B>-fdisable-rtl</B> for the description of
option arguments.
<DT id="1655"><B>-fenable-ipa-</B><I>pass</I><DD>


Enable <FONT SIZE="-1">IPA</FONT> pass <I>pass</I>.  <I>pass</I> is the pass name.  If the same pass is
statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the pass name should be
appended with a sequential number starting from 1.

<DT id="1661"><B>-fchecking</B><DD>



<DT id="1662"><B>-fchecking=</B><I>n</I><DD>



Enable internal consistency checking.  The default depends on
the compiler configuration.  <B>-fchecking=2</B> enables further
internal consistency checking that might affect code generation.
<DT id="1663"><B>-frandom-seed=</B><I>string</I><DD>


This option provides a seed that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses in place of
random numbers in generating certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the <B>-frandom-seed</B> option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.


<P>


The <I>string</I> can either be a number (decimal, octal or hex) or an
arbitrary string (in which case it's converted to a number by
computing <FONT SIZE="-1">CRC32</FONT>).


<P>


The <I>string</I> should be different for every file you compile.
<DT id="1664"><B>-save-temps</B><DD>



<DT id="1665"><B>-save-temps=cwd</B><DD>



Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <I>foo.c</I> with <B>-c -save-temps</B> produces files
<I>foo.i</I> and <I>foo.s</I>, as well as <I>foo.o</I>.  This creates a
preprocessed <I>foo.i</I> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.


<P>


When used in combination with the <B>-x</B> command-line option,
<B>-save-temps</B> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using <B>-save-temps</B>.


<P>


If you invoke <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&amp;
        gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&amp;

</PRE>




<P>


may result in <I>foo.i</I> and <I>foo.o</I> being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.
<DT id="1666"><B>-save-temps=obj</B><DD>


Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently.  If the
<B>-o</B> option is used, the temporary files are based on the
object file.  If the <B>-o</B> option is not used, the
<B>-save-temps=obj</B> switch behaves like <B>-save-temps</B>.


<P>


For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
        gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
        gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar

</PRE>




<P>


creates <I>foo.i</I>, <I>foo.s</I>, <I>dir/xbar.i</I>,
<I>dir/xbar.s</I>, <I>dir2/yfoobar.i</I>, <I>dir2/yfoobar.s</I>, and
<I>dir2/yfoobar.o</I>.
<DT id="1667"><B>-time</B>[<B>=</B><I>file</I>]<DD>


Report the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).


<P>


Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        # cc1 0.12 0.01
        # as 0.00 0.01

</PRE>




<P>


The first number on each line is the ``user time'', that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is ``system time'',
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.


<P>


With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        0.12 0.01 cc1 &lt;options&gt;
        0.00 0.01 as &lt;options&gt;

</PRE>




<P>


The ``user time'' and the ``system time'' are moved before the program
name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that one
can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which options.
<DT id="1668"><B>-fdump-final-insns</B>[<B>=</B><I>file</I>]<DD>


Dump the final internal representation (<FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT>) to <I>file</I>.  If the
optional argument is omitted (or if <I>file</I> is <TT>&quot;.&quot;</TT>), the name
of the dump file is determined by appending <TT>&quot;.gkd&quot;</TT> to the
compilation output file name.
<DT id="1669"><B>-fcompare-debug</B>[<B>=</B><I>opts</I>]<DD>


If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time,
adding <I>opts</I> and <B>-fcompare-debug-second</B> to the arguments
passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.


<P>


If the equal sign is omitted, the default <B>-gtoggle</B> is used.


<P>


The environment variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</B></FONT><B></B>, if defined, non-empty
and nonzero, implicitly enables <B>-fcompare-debug</B>.  If
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</B></FONT><B></B> is defined to a string starting with a dash,
then it is used for <I>opts</I>, otherwise the default <B>-gtoggle</B>
is used.


<P>


<B>-fcompare-debug=</B>, with the equal sign but without <I>opts</I>,
is equivalent to <B>-fno-compare-debug</B>, which disables the dumping
of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</B></FONT><B></B> from taking effect.


<P>


To verify full coverage during <B>-fcompare-debug</B> testing, set
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</B></FONT><B></B> to say <B>-fcompare-debug-not-overridden</B>,
which <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> rejects as an invalid option in any actual compilation
(rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
warning, setting <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</B></FONT><B></B> to <B>-w%n-fcompare-debug
not overridden</B> will do.
<DT id="1670"><B>-fcompare-debug-second</B><DD>


This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
compilation requested by <B>-fcompare-debug</B>, along with options to
silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause the compiler
to produce output to files or to standard output as a side effect.  Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the
<TT>&quot;.gk&quot;</TT> additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.


<P>


When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
<I>first</I> compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
other than debugging the compiler proper.
<DT id="1671"><B>-gtoggle</B><DD>


Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
<B>-fcompare-debug</B>.
<DT id="1672"><B>-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle</B><DD>


Toggle <B>-fvar-tracking-assignments</B>, in the same way that
<B>-gtoggle</B> toggles <B>-g</B>.
<DT id="1673"><B>-Q</B><DD>


Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
<DT id="1674"><B>-ftime-report</B><DD>


Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each
pass when it finishes.
<DT id="1675"><B>-ftime-report-details</B><DD>


Record the time consumed by infrastructure parts separately for each pass.
<DT id="1676"><B>-fira-verbose=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated register allocator.
The default value is 5.  If the value <I>n</I> is greater or equal to 10,
the dump output is sent to stderr using the same format as <I>n</I> minus 10.
<DT id="1677"><B>-flto-report</B><DD>


Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time
optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from version to version.
It is meant to be useful to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> developers when processing object
files in <FONT SIZE="-1">LTO</FONT> mode (via <B>-flto</B>).


<P>


Disabled by default.
<DT id="1678"><B>-flto-report-wpa</B><DD>


Like <B>-flto-report</B>, but only print for the <FONT SIZE="-1">WPA</FONT> phase of Link
Time Optimization.
<DT id="1679"><B>-fmem-report</B><DD>


Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.
<DT id="1680"><B>-fmem-report-wpa</B><DD>


Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation for the <FONT SIZE="-1">WPA</FONT> phase only.
<DT id="1681"><B>-fpre-ipa-mem-report</B><DD>



<DT id="1682"><B>-fpost-ipa-mem-report</B><DD>



Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation before or after interprocedural optimization.
<DT id="1683"><B>-fprofile-report</B><DD>


Makes the compiler print some statistics about consistency of the
(estimated) profile and effect of individual passes.
<DT id="1684"><B>-fstack-usage</B><DD>


Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a
per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by appending
<I>.su</I> to the <I>auxname</I>.  <I>auxname</I> is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1685"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1686">*<DD>
The name of the function.
<DT id="1687">*<DD>
A number of bytes.
<DT id="1688">*<DD>
One or more qualifiers: <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;dynamic&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bounded&quot;</TT>.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="1689"><DD>


<P>


The qualifier <TT>&quot;static&quot;</TT> means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.


<P>


The qualifier <TT>&quot;dynamic&quot;</TT> means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier <TT>&quot;bounded&quot;</TT> is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.
</DL>

<DT id="1690"><B>-fstats</B><DD>


Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This option is supported only by the C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> front end, and
the information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
<DT id="1691"><B>-fdbg-cnt-list</B><DD>


Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.
<DT id="1692"><B>-fdbg-cnt=</B><I>counter-value-list</I><DD>


Set the internal debug counter lower and upper bound.  <I>counter-value-list</I>
is a comma-separated list of <I>name</I>:<I>lower_bound</I>:<I>upper_bound</I>
tuples which sets the lower and the upper bound of each debug
counter <I>name</I>.  The <I>lower_bound</I> is optional and is zero
initialized if not set.
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of <TT>&quot;UINT_MAX&quot;</TT>;
thus <TT>&quot;dbg_cnt&quot;</TT> returns true always unless the upper bound
is set by this option.
For example, with <B>-fdbg-cnt=dce:2:4,tail_call:10</B>,
<TT>&quot;dbg_cnt(dce)&quot;</TT> returns true only for third and fourth invocation.
For <TT>&quot;dbg_cnt(tail_call)&quot;</TT> true is returned for first 10 invocations.
<DT id="1693"><B>-print-file-name=</B><I>library</I><DD>


Print the full absolute name of the library file <I>library</I> that
would be used when linking---and don't do anything else.  With this
option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.
<DT id="1694"><B>-print-multi-directory</B><DD>


Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.
<DT id="1695"><B>-print-multi-lib</B><DD>


Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
<B>;</B>, and each switch starts with an <B>@</B> instead of the
<B>-</B>, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell processing.
<DT id="1696"><B>-print-multi-os-directory</B><DD>


Print the path to <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some <I>lib</I> subdirectory.  If <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> libraries are
present in the <I>lib</I> subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just <I>.</I>, if <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> libraries are present in <I>libsuffix</I>
sibling directories this prints e.g. <I>../lib64</I>, <I>../lib</I> or
<I>../lib32</I>, or if <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> libraries are present in <I>lib/subdir</I>
subdirectories it prints e.g. <I>amd64</I>, <I>sparcv9</I> or <I>ev6</I>.
<DT id="1697"><B>-print-multiarch</B><DD>


Print the path to <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> libraries for the selected multiarch,
relative to some <I>lib</I> subdirectory.
<DT id="1698"><B>-print-prog-name=</B><I>program</I><DD>


Like <B>-print-file-name</B>, but searches for a program such as <B>cpp</B>.
<DT id="1699"><B>-print-libgcc-file-name</B><DD>


Same as <B>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</B>.


<P>


This is useful when you use <B>-nostdlib</B> or <B>-nodefaultlibs</B>
but you do want to link with <I>libgcc.a</I>.  You can do:


<P>




<PRE>
        gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

</PRE>


<DT id="1700"><B>-print-search-dirs</B><DD>


Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories <B>gcc</B> searches---and don't do anything else.


<P>


This is useful when <B>gcc</B> prints the error message
<B>installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</B>.
To resolve this you either need to put <I>cpp0</I> and the other compiler
components where <B>gcc</B> expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> to the directory where you installed them.
Don't forget the trailing <B>/</B>.
<DT id="1701"><B>-print-sysroot</B><DD>


Print the target sysroot directory that is used during
compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at configure
time or using the <B>--sysroot</B> option, possibly with an extra
suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is
specified, the option prints nothing.
<DT id="1702"><B>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix</B><DD>


Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with such
a suffix---and don't do anything else.
<DT id="1703"><B>-dumpmachine</B><DD>


Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
<B>i686-pc-linux-gnu</B>)---and don't do anything else.
<DT id="1704"><B>-dumpversion</B><DD>


Print the compiler version (for example, <TT>3.0</TT>, <TT>6.3.0</TT> or <TT>7</TT>)---and don't do
anything else.  This is the compiler version used in filesystem paths and
specs. Depending on how the compiler has been configured it can be just
a single number (major version), two numbers separated by a dot (major and
minor version) or three numbers separated by dots (major, minor and patchlevel
version).
<DT id="1705"><B>-dumpfullversion</B><DD>


Print the full compiler version---and don't do anything else. The output is
always three numbers separated by dots, major, minor and patchlevel version.
<DT id="1706"><B>-dumpspecs</B><DD>


Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> itself is being built.)
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Machine-Dependent Options</H3>



Each target machine supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can have its own options---for
example, to allow you to compile for a particular processor variant or
<FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> or to control optimizations specific to that machine.  By
convention, the names of machine-specific options start with
<B>-m</B>.
<P>

Some configurations of the compiler also support additional target-specific
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.
<P>

<I>AArch64 Options</I>


<P>

These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1707"><B>-mabi=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Generate code for the specified data model.  Permissible values
are <B>ilp32</B> for SysV-like data model where int, long int and pointers
are 32 bits, and <B>lp64</B> for SysV-like data model where int is 32 bits,
but long int and pointers are 64 bits.


<P>


The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the <FONT SIZE="-1">LP64</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">ILP32</FONT> ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your
entire program with the same <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> and link with a compatible set of libraries.
<DT id="1708"><B>-mbig-endian</B><DD>


Generate big-endian code.  This is the default when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is configured for an
<B>aarch64_be-*-*</B> target.
<DT id="1709"><B>-mgeneral-regs-only</B><DD>


Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers.  This will prevent
the compiler from using floating-point and Advanced <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> registers but will not
impose any restrictions on the assembler.
<DT id="1710"><B>-mlittle-endian</B><DD>


Generate little-endian code.  This is the default when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is configured for an
<B>aarch64-*-*</B> but not an <B>aarch64_be-*-*</B> target.
<DT id="1711"><B>-mcmodel=tiny</B><DD>


Generate code for the tiny code model.  The program and its statically defined
symbols must be within 1MB of each other.  Programs can be statically or
dynamically linked.
<DT id="1712"><B>-mcmodel=small</B><DD>


Generate code for the small code model.  The program and its statically defined
symbols must be within 4GB of each other.  Programs can be statically or
dynamically linked.  This is the default code model.
<DT id="1713"><B>-mcmodel=large</B><DD>


Generate code for the large code model.  This makes no assumptions about
addresses and sizes of sections.  Programs can be statically linked only.
<DT id="1714"><B>-mstrict-align</B><DD>



<DT id="1715"><B>-mno-strict-align</B><DD>



Avoid or allow generating memory accesses that may not be aligned on a natural
object boundary as described in the architecture specification.
<DT id="1716"><B>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</B><DD>



<DT id="1717"><B>-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer</B><DD>



Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions.  The former behavior is the
default.
<DT id="1718"><B>-mstack-protector-guard=</B><I>guard</I><DD>



<DT id="1719"><B>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</B><I>reg</I><DD>


<DT id="1720"><B>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</B><I>offset</I><DD>



Generate stack protection code using canary at <I>guard</I>.  Supported
locations are <B>global</B> for a global canary or <B>sysreg</B> for a
canary in an appropriate system register.


<P>


With the latter choice the options
<B>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</B><I>reg</I> and
<B>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</B><I>offset</I> furthermore specify
which system register to use as base register for reading the canary,
and from what offset from that base register. There is no default
register or offset as this is entirely for use within the Linux
kernel.
<DT id="1721"><B>-mstack-protector-guard=</B><I>guard</I><DD>



<DT id="1722"><B>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</B><I>reg</I><DD>


<DT id="1723"><B>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</B><I>offset</I><DD>



Generate stack protection code using canary at <I>guard</I>.  Supported
locations are <B>global</B> for a global canary or <B>sysreg</B> for a
canary in an appropriate system register.


<P>


With the latter choice the options
<B>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</B><I>reg</I> and
<B>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</B><I>offset</I> furthermore specify
which system register to use as base register for reading the canary,
and from what offset from that base register. There is no default
register or offset as this is entirely for use within the Linux
kernel.
<DT id="1724"><B>-mtls-dialect=desc</B><DD>


Use <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> variables.  This is the default.
<DT id="1725"><B>-mtls-dialect=traditional</B><DD>


Use traditional <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> variables.
<DT id="1726"><B>-mtls-size=</B><I>size</I><DD>


Specify bit size of immediate <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> offsets.  Valid values are 12, 24, 32, 48.
This option requires binutils 2.26 or newer.
<DT id="1727"><B>-mfix-cortex-a53-835769</B><DD>



<DT id="1728"><B>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769</B><DD>



Enable or disable the workaround for the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> Cortex-A53 erratum number 835769.
This involves inserting a <FONT SIZE="-1">NOP</FONT> instruction between memory instructions and
64-bit integer multiply-accumulate instructions.
<DT id="1729"><B>-mfix-cortex-a53-843419</B><DD>



<DT id="1730"><B>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-843419</B><DD>



Enable or disable the workaround for the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> Cortex-A53 erratum number 843419.
This erratum workaround is made at link time and this will only pass the
corresponding flag to the linker.
<DT id="1731"><B>-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt</B><DD>



<DT id="1732"><B>-mno-low-precision-recip-sqrt</B><DD>



Enable or disable the reciprocal square root approximation.
This option only has an effect if <B>-ffast-math</B> or
<B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> is used as well.  Enabling this reduces
precision of reciprocal square root results to about 16 bits for
single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.
<DT id="1733"><B>-mlow-precision-sqrt</B><DD>



<DT id="1734"><B>-mno-low-precision-sqrt</B><DD>



Enable or disable the square root approximation.
This option only has an effect if <B>-ffast-math</B> or
<B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> is used as well.  Enabling this reduces
precision of square root results to about 16 bits for
single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.
If enabled, it implies <B>-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt</B>.
<DT id="1735"><B>-mlow-precision-div</B><DD>



<DT id="1736"><B>-mno-low-precision-div</B><DD>



Enable or disable the division approximation.
This option only has an effect if <B>-ffast-math</B> or
<B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> is used as well.  Enabling this reduces
precision of division results to about 16 bits for
single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.
<DT id="1737"><B>-mtrack-speculation</B><DD>



<DT id="1738"><B>-mno-track-speculation</B><DD>



Enable or disable generation of additional code to track speculative
execution through conditional branches.  The tracking state can then
be used by the compiler when expanding calls to
<TT>&quot;__builtin_speculation_safe_copy&quot;</TT> to permit a more efficient code
sequence to be generated.
<DT id="1739"><B>-moutline-atomics</B><DD>



<DT id="1740"><B>-mno-outline-atomics</B><DD>



Enable or disable calls to out-of-line helpers to implement atomic operations.
These helpers will, at runtime, determine if the <FONT SIZE="-1">LSE</FONT> instructions from
ARMv8.1-A can be used; if not, they will use the load/store-exclusive
instructions that are present in the base ARMv8.0 <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA.</FONT>


<P>


This option is only applicable when compiling for the base ARMv8.0
instruction set.  If using a later revision, e.g. <B>-march=armv8.1-a</B>
or <B>-march=armv8-a+lse</B>, the ARMv8.1-Atomics instructions will be
used directly.  The same applies when using <B>-mcpu=</B> when the
selected cpu supports the <B>lse</B> feature.
<DT id="1741"><B>-march=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Specify the name of the target architecture and, optionally, one or
more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
<B>-march=</B><I>arch</I>{<B>+</B>[<B>no</B>]<I>feature</I>}*.


<P>


The permissible values for <I>arch</I> are <B>armv8-a</B>,
<B>armv8.1-a</B>, <B>armv8.2-a</B>, <B>armv8.3-a</B>, <B>armv8.4-a</B>,
<B>armv8.5-a</B> or <I>native</I>.


<P>


The value <B>armv8.5-a</B> implies <B>armv8.4-a</B> and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.5-A architecture extensions.


<P>


The value <B>armv8.4-a</B> implies <B>armv8.3-a</B> and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.4-A architecture extensions.


<P>


The value <B>armv8.3-a</B> implies <B>armv8.2-a</B> and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.3-A architecture extensions.


<P>


The value <B>armv8.2-a</B> implies <B>armv8.1-a</B> and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.2-A architecture extensions.


<P>


The value <B>armv8.1-a</B> implies <B>armv8-a</B> and enables compiler
support for the ARMv8.1-A architecture extension.  In particular, it
enables the <B>+crc</B>, <B>+lse</B>, and <B>+rdma</B> features.


<P>


The value <B>native</B> is available on native AArch64 GNU/Linux and
causes the compiler to pick the architecture of the host system.  This
option has no effect if the compiler is unable to recognize the
architecture of the host system,


<P>


The permissible values for <I>feature</I> are listed in the sub-section
on <B>aarch64-feature-modifiers,,</B><B>-march</B> <B>and</B> <B>-mcpu</B>
<B>Feature Modifiers</B>.  Where conflicting feature modifiers are
specified, the right-most feature is used.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses <I>name</I> to determine what kind of instructions it can emit
when generating assembly code.  If <B>-march</B> is specified
without either of <B>-mtune</B> or <B>-mcpu</B> also being
specified, the code is tuned to perform well across a range of target
processors implementing the target architecture.
<DT id="1742"><B>-mtune=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Specify the name of the target processor for which <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> should tune the
performance of the code.  Permissible values for this option are:
<B>generic</B>, <B>cortex-a35</B>, <B>cortex-a53</B>, <B>cortex-a55</B>,
<B>cortex-a57</B>, <B>cortex-a72</B>, <B>cortex-a73</B>, <B>cortex-a75</B>,
<B>cortex-a76</B>, <B>ares</B>, <B>exynos-m1</B>, <B>emag</B>, <B>falkor</B>,
<B>neoverse-e1</B>,<B>neoverse-n1</B>,<B>qdf24xx</B>, <B>saphira</B>,
<B>phecda</B>, <B>xgene1</B>, <B>vulcan</B>, <B>octeontx</B>,
<B>octeontx81</B>,  <B>octeontx83</B>,
<B>a64fx</B>,
<B>thunderx</B>, <B>thunderxt88</B>,
<B>thunderxt88p1</B>, <B>thunderxt81</B>, <B>tsv110</B>,
<B>thunderxt83</B>, <B>thunderx2t99</B>, <B>zeus</B>,
<B>cortex-a57.cortex-a53</B>, <B>cortex-a72.cortex-a53</B>,
<B>cortex-a73.cortex-a35</B>, <B>cortex-a73.cortex-a53</B>,
<B>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</B>, <B>cortex-a76.cortex-a55</B>
<B>native</B>.


<P>


The values <B>cortex-a57.cortex-a53</B>, <B>cortex-a72.cortex-a53</B>,
<B>cortex-a73.cortex-a35</B>, <B>cortex-a73.cortex-a53</B>,
<B>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</B>, <B>cortex-a76.cortex-a55</B> specify that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
should tune for a big.LITTLE system.


<P>


Additionally on native AArch64 GNU/Linux systems the value
<B>native</B> tunes performance to the host system.  This option has no effect
if the compiler is unable to recognize the processor of the host system.


<P>


Where none of <B>-mtune=</B>, <B>-mcpu=</B> or <B>-march=</B>
are specified, the code is tuned to perform well across a range
of target processors.


<P>


This option cannot be suffixed by feature modifiers.
<DT id="1743"><B>-mcpu=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Specify the name of the target processor, optionally suffixed by one
or more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
<B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu</I>{<B>+</B>[<B>no</B>]<I>feature</I>}*, where
the permissible values for <I>cpu</I> are the same as those available
for <B>-mtune</B>.  The permissible values for <I>feature</I> are
documented in the sub-section on
<B>aarch64-feature-modifiers,,</B><B>-march</B> <B>and</B> <B>-mcpu</B>
<B>Feature Modifiers</B>.  Where conflicting feature modifiers are
specified, the right-most feature is used.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses <I>name</I> to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
generating assembly code (as if by <B>-march</B>) and to determine
the target processor for which to tune for performance (as if
by <B>-mtune</B>).  Where this option is used in conjunction

<DT id="1744"><B>-moverride=</B><I>string</I><DD>


Override tuning decisions made by the back-end in response to a

provided for use in debugging the compiler.
<DT id="1746"><B>-mpc-relative-literal-loads</B><DD>



<DT id="1747"><B>-mno-pc-relative-literal-loads</B><DD>



Enable or disable PC-relative literal loads.  With this option literal pools are
accessed using a single instruction and emitted after each function.  This
limits the maximum size of functions to 1MB.  This is enabled by default for
<B>-mcmodel=tiny</B>.
<DT id="1748"><B>-msign-return-address=</B><I>scope</I><DD>


Select the function scope on which return address signing will be applied.
Permissible values are <B>none</B>, which disables return address signing,
<B>non-leaf</B>, which enables pointer signing for functions which are not leaf
functions, and <B>all</B>, which enables pointer signing for all functions.  The
default value is <B>none</B>. This option has been deprecated by
-mbranch-protection.

Select the branch protection features to use.
<B>none</B> is the default and turns off all types of branch protection.
<B>standard</B> turns on all types of branch protection features.  If a feature
has additional tuning options, then <B>standard</B> sets it to its standard
level.
<B>pac-ret[+</B><I>leaf</I><B>]</B> turns on return address signing to its standard
level: signing functions that save the return address to memory (non-leaf
functions will practically always do this) using the a-key.  The optional
argument <B>leaf</B> can be used to extend the signing to include leaf
functions.
<B>bti</B> turns on branch target identification mechanism.
<DT id="1750"><B>-mharden-sls=</B><I>opts</I><DD>

<DT id="1755"><B>-msve-vector-bits=</B><I>bits</I><DD>


Specify the number of bits in an <FONT SIZE="-1">SVE</FONT> vector register.  This option only has
an effect when <FONT SIZE="-1">SVE</FONT> is enabled.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports two forms of <FONT SIZE="-1">SVE</FONT> code generation: ``vector-length
agnostic'' output that works with any size of vector register and
``vector-length specific'' output that allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to make assumptions
about the vector length when it is useful for optimization reasons.
The possible values of <B>bits</B> are: <B>scalable</B>, <B>128</B>,
<B>256</B>, <B>512</B>, <B>1024</B> and <B>2048</B>.
Specifying <B>scalable</B> selects vector-length agnostic
output.  At present <B>-msve-vector-bits=128</B> also generates vector-length
agnostic output.  All other values generate vector-length specific code.
The behavior of these values may change in future releases and no value except
<B>scalable</B> should be relied on for producing code that is portable across
different hardware <FONT SIZE="-1">SVE</FONT> vector lengths.


<P>


The default is <B>-msve-vector-bits=scalable</B>, which produces
vector-length agnostic code.

<I>Adapteva Epiphany Options</I>


<P>

These <B>-m</B> options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1777"><B>-mhalf-reg-file</B><DD>


Don't allocate any register in the range <TT>&quot;r32&quot;</TT>...<TT>&quot;r63&quot;</TT>.
That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these registers.
<DT id="1778"><B>-mprefer-short-insn-regs</B><DD>


Preferentially allocate registers that allow short instruction generation.
This can result in increased instruction count, so this may either reduce or
increase overall code size.
<DT id="1779"><B>-mbranch-cost=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Set the cost of branches to roughly <I>num</I> ``simple'' instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.
<DT id="1780"><B>-mcmove</B><DD>


Enable the generation of conditional moves.
<DT id="1781"><B>-mnops=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Emit <I>num</I> NOPs before every other generated instruction.
<DT id="1782"><B>-mno-soft-cmpsf</B><DD>


For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an <TT>&quot;fsub&quot;</TT> instruction
and test the flags.  This is faster than a software comparison, but can
get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs, or when two different small
numbers are compared such that their difference is calculated as zero.
The default is <B>-msoft-cmpsf</B>, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant,
software comparisons.
<DT id="1783"><B>-mstack-offset=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer.
E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range <TT>&quot;sp+0...sp+7&quot;</TT>
can be used by leaf functions without stack allocation.
Values other than <B>8</B> or <B>16</B> are untested and unlikely to work.
Note also that this option changes the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>; compiling a program with a
different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
generally does not work.
This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack
offset would give you better code, but to actually use a different stack
offset to build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate <B>--with-stack-offset=</B><I>num</I> option.
<DT id="1784"><B>-mno-round-nearest</B><DD>


Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
truncating.  The default is <B>-mround-nearest</B>.
<DT id="1785"><B>-mlong-calls</B><DD>


If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be beyond
the offset range of the <TT>&quot;b&quot;</TT> / <TT>&quot;bl&quot;</TT> instructions, and therefore load the
function address into a register before performing a (otherwise direct) call.
This is the default.
<DT id="1786"><B>-mshort-calls</B><DD>


If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are
in the range of the <TT>&quot;b&quot;</TT> / <TT>&quot;bl&quot;</TT> instructions, so use these instructions
for direct calls.  The default is <B>-mlong-calls</B>.
<DT id="1787"><B>-msmall16</B><DD>


Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.  This does not
apply to function addresses for which <B>-mlong-calls</B> semantics
are in effect.
<DT id="1788"><B>-mfp-mode=</B><I>mode</I><DD>


Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.
This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected
at function call and return time.  Making this mode match the mode you
predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller and
faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.


<P>


<I>mode</I> can be set to one the following values:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1789"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1790"><B>caller</B><DD>


Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when
the function returns, and when it calls other functions.
This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other compilation units
you might want to incorporate into different programs with different
prevailing <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> modes, and the convenience of being able to use a single
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any extra
mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed
with a more specific choice of prevailing <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> mode.
<DT id="1791"><B>truncate</B><DD>


This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.  That includes
conversion from floating point to integer.
<DT id="1792"><B>round-nearest</B><DD>


This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.
<DT id="1793"><B>int</B><DD>


This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU,</FONT> e.g.
integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.

<DT id="1796"><B>-mno-postinc</B><DD>


<DT id="1797"><B>-mno-postmodify</B><DD>



Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting of 32-bit

post-modify addresses.  The defaults are <B>msplit-lohi</B>,
<B>-mpost-inc</B>, and <B>-mpost-modify</B>.
<DT id="1798"><B>-mnovect-double</B><DD>


Change the preferred <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> mode to SImode.  The default is
<B>-mvect-double</B>, which uses DImode as preferred <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> mode.
<DT id="1799"><B>-max-vect-align=</B><I>num</I><DD>


The maximum alignment for <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> vector mode types.
<I>num</I> may be 4 or 8.  The default is 8.
Note that this is an <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> change, even though many library function
interfaces are unaffected if they don't use <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> vector modes
in places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant types.
<DT id="1800"><B>-msplit-vecmove-early</B><DD>


Split vector moves into single word moves before reload.  In theory this
can give better register allocation, but so far the reverse seems to be
generally the case.
<DT id="1801"><B>-m1reg-</B><I>reg</I><DD>


Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes loading small negative
constants and certain bitmasks faster.
Allowable values for <I>reg</I> are <B>r43</B> and <B>r63</B>,
which specify use of that register as a fixed register,
and <B>none</B>, which means that no register is used for this

<DT id="1894"><B>-mirq-ctrl-saved=</B><I>register-range</I><B>,</B> <I>blink</I><B>,</B> <I>lp_count</I><DD>


Specifies general-purposes registers that the processor automatically
saves/restores on interrupt entry and exit.  <I>register-range</I> is
specified as two registers separated by a dash.  The register range
always starts with <TT>&quot;r0&quot;</TT>, the upper limit is <TT>&quot;fp&quot;</TT> register.
<I>blink</I> and <I>lp_count</I> are optional.  This option is only
valid for <FONT SIZE="-1">ARC EM</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">ARC HS</FONT> cores.
<DT id="1895"><B>-mrgf-banked-regs=</B><I>number</I><DD>


Specifies the number of registers replicated in second register bank
on entry to fast interrupt.  Fast interrupts are interrupts with the
highest priority level P0.  These interrupts save only <FONT SIZE="-1">PC</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">STATUS32</FONT>
registers to avoid memory transactions during interrupt entry and exit
sequences.  Use this option when you are using fast interrupts in an
<FONT SIZE="-1">ARC V2</FONT> family processor.  Permitted values are 4, 8, 16, and 32.
<DT id="1896"><B>-mlpc-width=</B><I>width</I><DD>


Specify the width of the <TT>&quot;lp_count&quot;</TT> register.  Valid values for
<I>width</I> are 8, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 bits.  The default width is
fixed to 32 bits.  If the width is less than 32, the compiler does not
attempt to transform loops in your program to use the zero-delay loop
mechanism unless it is known that the <TT>&quot;lp_count&quot;</TT> register can
hold the required loop-counter value.  Depending on the width
specified, the compiler and run-time library might continue to use the
loop mechanism for various needs.  This option defines macro
<TT>&quot;__ARC_LPC_WIDTH__&quot;</TT> with the value of <I>width</I>.
<DT id="1897"><B>-mrf16</B><DD>


This option instructs the compiler to generate code for a 16-entry
register file.  This option defines the <TT>&quot;__ARC_RF16__&quot;</TT>

<TT>&quot;arceb-linux-uclibc&quot;</TT> targets when profiling is requested.
</DL>
<P>

The following options control the semantics of generated code:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1912"><B>-mlong-calls</B><DD>


Generate calls as register indirect calls, thus providing access
to the full 32-bit address range.
<DT id="1913"><B>-mmedium-calls</B><DD>


Don't use less than 25-bit addressing range for calls, which is the
offset available for an unconditional branch-and-link
instruction.  Conditional execution of function calls is suppressed, to
allow use of the 25-bit range, rather than the 21-bit range with
conditional branch-and-link.  This is the default for tool chains built
for <TT>&quot;arc-linux-uclibc&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;arceb-linux-uclibc&quot;</TT> targets.
<DT id="1914"><B>-G</B> <I>num</I><DD>


Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data section if
that data is no bigger than <I>num</I> bytes.  The default value of
<I>num</I> is 4 for any <FONT SIZE="-1">ARC</FONT> configuration, or 8 when we have double
load/store operations.
<DT id="1915"><B>-mno-sdata</B><DD>


Do not generate sdata references.  This is the default for tool chains
built for <TT>&quot;arc-linux-uclibc&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;arceb-linux-uclibc&quot;</TT>
targets.
<DT id="1916"><B>-mvolatile-cache</B><DD>


Use ordinarily cached memory accesses for volatile references.  This is the
default.
<DT id="1917"><B>-mno-volatile-cache</B><DD>


Enable cache bypass for volatile references.
</DL>
<P>

The following options fine tune code generation:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1918"><B>-malign-call</B><DD>


Do alignment optimizations for call instructions.
<DT id="1919"><B>-mauto-modify-reg</B><DD>


Enable the use of pre/post modify with register displacement.
<DT id="1920"><B>-mbbit-peephole</B><DD>


Enable bbit peephole2.
<DT id="1921"><B>-mno-brcc</B><DD>


This option disables a target-specific pass in <I>arc_reorg</I> to
generate compare-and-branch (<TT>&quot;br</TT>cc<TT>&quot;</TT>) instructions.  
It has no effect on
generation of these instructions driven by the combiner pass.
<DT id="1922"><B>-mcase-vector-pcrel</B><DD>


Use PC-relative switch case tables to enable case table shortening.
This is the default for <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="1923"><B>-mcompact-casesi</B><DD>


Enable compact <TT>&quot;casesi&quot;</TT> pattern.  This is the default for <B>-Os</B>,
and only available for ARCv1 cores.  This option is deprecated.
<DT id="1924"><B>-mno-cond-exec</B><DD>


Disable the ARCompact-specific pass to generate conditional 
execution instructions.


<P>


Due to delay slot scheduling and interactions between operand numbers,
literal sizes, instruction lengths, and the support for conditional execution,
the target-independent pass to generate conditional execution is often lacking,
so the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARC</FONT> port has kept a special pass around that tries to find more
conditional execution generation opportunities after register allocation,
branch shortening, and delay slot scheduling have been done.  This pass
generally, but not always, improves performance and code size, at the cost of
extra compilation time, which is why there is an option to switch it off.
If you have a problem with call instructions exceeding their allowable
offset range because they are conditionalized, you should consider using
<B>-mmedium-calls</B> instead.
<DT id="1925"><B>-mearly-cbranchsi</B><DD>


Enable pre-reload use of the <TT>&quot;cbranchsi&quot;</TT> pattern.
<DT id="1926"><B>-mexpand-adddi</B><DD>


Expand <TT>&quot;adddi3&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;subdi3&quot;</TT> at <FONT SIZE="-1">RTL</FONT> generation time into
<TT>&quot;add.f&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;adc&quot;</TT> etc.  This option is deprecated.
<DT id="1927"><B>-mindexed-loads</B><DD>


Enable the use of indexed loads.  This can be problematic because some
optimizers then assume that indexed stores exist, which is not
the case.
<DT id="1928"><B>-mlra</B><DD>


Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is still experimental for <FONT SIZE="-1">ARC,</FONT>
so by default the compiler uses standard reload
(i.e. <B>-mno-lra</B>).
<DT id="1929"><B>-mlra-priority-none</B><DD>


Don't indicate any priority for target registers.
<DT id="1930"><B>-mlra-priority-compact</B><DD>


Indicate target register priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.
<DT id="1931"><B>-mlra-priority-noncompact</B><DD>


Reduce target register priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.
<DT id="1932"><B>-mmillicode</B><DD>


When optimizing for size (using <B>-Os</B>), prologues and epilogues
that have to save or restore a large number of registers are often
shortened by using call to a special function in libgcc; this is
referred to as a <I>millicode</I> call.  As these calls can pose
performance issues, and/or cause linking issues when linking in a
nonstandard way, this option is provided to turn on or off millicode
call generation.
<DT id="1933"><B>-mcode-density-frame</B><DD>


This option enable the compiler to emit <TT>&quot;enter&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;leave&quot;</TT>
instructions.  These instructions are only valid for CPUs with
code-density feature.
<DT id="1934"><B>-mmixed-code</B><DD>


Tweak register allocation to help 16-bit instruction generation.
This generally has the effect of decreasing the average instruction size
while increasing the instruction count.
<DT id="1935"><B>-mq-class</B><DD>


Enable <B>q</B> instruction alternatives.
This is the default for <B>-Os</B>.
<DT id="1936"><B>-mRcq</B><DD>


Enable <B>Rcq</B> constraint handling.  
Most short code generation depends on this.
This is the default.
<DT id="1937"><B>-mRcw</B><DD>


Enable <B>Rcw</B> constraint handling.  
Most ccfsm condexec mostly depends on this.
This is the default.
<DT id="1938"><B>-msize-level=</B><I>level</I><DD>


Fine-tune size optimization with regards to instruction lengths and alignment.
The recognized values for <I>level</I> are:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="1939"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1940"><B>0</B><DD>


No size optimization.  This level is deprecated and treated like <B>1</B>.

Short instructions are used opportunistically.
<DT id="1942"><B>2</B><DD>


In addition, alignment of loops and of code after barriers are dropped.
<DT id="1943"><B>3</B><DD>


In addition, optional data alignment is dropped, and the option <B>Os</B> is enabled.

These <B>-m</B> options are defined for the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> port:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1972"><B>-mabi=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Generate code for the specified <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  Permissible values are: <B>apcs-gnu</B>,
<B>atpcs</B>, <B>aapcs</B>, <B>aapcs-linux</B> and <B>iwmmxt</B>.
<DT id="1973"><B>-mapcs-frame</B><DD>


Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying <B>-fomit-frame-pointer</B>
with this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is <B>-mno-apcs-frame</B>.
This option is deprecated.
<DT id="1974"><B>-mapcs</B><DD>


This is a synonym for <B>-mapcs-frame</B> and is deprecated.
<DT id="1975"><B>-mthumb-interwork</B><DD>


Generate code that supports calling between the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre-v5 architectures, the
two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The
default is <B>-mno-thumb-interwork</B>, since slightly larger code
is generated when <B>-mthumb-interwork</B> is specified.  In <FONT SIZE="-1">AAPCS</FONT>
configurations this option is meaningless.
<DT id="1976"><B>-mno-sched-prolog</B><DD>


Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is <B>-msched-prolog</B>.
<DT id="1977"><B>-mfloat-abi=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Specifies which floating-point <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> to use.  Permissible values
are: <B>soft</B>, <B>softfp</B> and <B>hard</B>.


<P>


Specifying <B>soft</B> causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations.
<B>softfp</B> allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.
<B>hard</B> allows generation of floating-point instructions
and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.


<P>


The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> and link with a
compatible set of libraries.
<DT id="1978"><B>-mgeneral-regs-only</B><DD>


Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers.  This will prevent
the compiler from using floating-point and Advanced <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> registers but will not
impose any restrictions on the assembler.
<DT id="1979"><B>-mlittle-endian</B><DD>


Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.
<DT id="1980"><B>-mbig-endian</B><DD>


Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.
<DT id="1981"><B>-mbe8</B><DD>



<DT id="1982"><B>-mbe32</B><DD>



When linking a big-endian image select between <FONT SIZE="-1">BE8</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">BE32</FONT> formats.
The option has no effect for little-endian images and is ignored.  The
default is dependent on the selected target architecture.  For ARMv6
and later architectures the default is <FONT SIZE="-1">BE8,</FONT> for older architectures
the default is <FONT SIZE="-1">BE32.</FONT>  <FONT SIZE="-1">BE32</FONT> format has been deprecated by <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM.</FONT>
<DT id="1983"><B>-march=</B><I>name</I>[<B>+extension...</B>]<DD>


This specifies the name of the target <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> architecture.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the <B>-mcpu=</B> option.


<P>


Permissible names are:
<B>armv4t</B>,
<B>armv5t</B>, <B>armv5te</B>,
<B>armv6</B>, <B>armv6j</B>, <B>armv6k</B>, <B>armv6kz</B>, <B>armv6t2</B>,

<B>armv8-m.base</B>, <B>armv8-m.main</B>,
<B>iwmmxt</B> and <B>iwmmxt2</B>.


<P>


Additionally, the following architectures, which lack support for the
Thumb execution state, are recognized but support is deprecated: <B>armv4</B>.


<P>


Many of the architectures support extensions.  These can be added by
appending <B>+</B><I>extension</I> to the architecture name.  Extension
options are processed in order and capabilities accumulate.  An extension
will also enable any necessary base extensions
upon which it depends.  For example, the <B>+crypto</B> extension
will always enable the <B>+simd</B> extension.  The exception to the
additive construction is for extensions that are prefixed with
<B>+no...</B>: these extensions disable the specified option and
any other extensions that may depend on the presence of that
extension.


<P>


For example, <B>-march=armv7-a+simd+nofp+vfpv4</B> is equivalent to
writing <B>-march=armv7-a+vfpv4</B> since the <B>+simd</B> option is
entirely disabled by the <B>+nofp</B> option that follows it.


<P>


Most extension names are generically named, but have an effect that is
dependent upon the architecture to which it is applied.  For example,
the <B>+simd</B> option can be applied to both <B>armv7-a</B> and
<B>armv8-a</B> architectures, but will enable the original ARMv7-A
Advanced <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> (Neon) extensions for <B>armv7-a</B> and the ARMv8-A
variant for <B>armv8-a</B>.


<P>

<P>


<B>-mtune</B> permits the same extension options as <B>-mcpu</B>, but
the extension options do not affect the tuning of the generated code.


<P>


<B>-mtune=native</B> causes the compiler to auto-detect the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect is
unsuccessful the option has no effect.
<DT id="2119"><B>-mcpu=</B><I>name</I>[<B>+extension...</B>]<DD>


This specifies the name of the target <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> processor.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses this name
to derive the name of the target <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> architecture (as if specified
by <B>-march</B>) and the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> processor type for which to tune for
performance (as if specified by <B>-mtune</B>).  Where this option
is used in conjunction with <B>-march</B> or <B>-mtune</B>,
those options take precedence over the appropriate part of this option.


<P>


Many of the supported CPUs implement optional architectural
extensions.  Where this is so the architectural extensions are
normally enabled by default.  If implementations that lack the
extension exist, then the extension syntax can be used to disable
those extensions that have been omitted.  For floating-point and
Advanced <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> (Neon) instructions, the settings of the options
<B>-mfloat-abi</B> and <B>-mfpu</B> must also be considered:
floating-point and Advanced <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> instructions will only be used if
<B>-mfloat-abi</B> is not set to <B>soft</B>; and any setting of
<B>-mfpu</B> other than <B>auto</B> will override the available
floating-point and <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> extension instructions.


<P>


For example, <B>cortex-a9</B> can be found in three major
configurations: integer only, with just a floating-point unit or with
floating-point and Advanced <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD.</FONT>  The default is to enable all the
instructions, but the extensions <B>+nosimd</B> and <B>+nofp</B> can
be used to disable just the <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> or both the <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> and floating-point
instructions respectively.


<P>


Permissible names for this option are the same as those for
<B>-mtune</B>.


<P>


The following extension options are common to the listed CPUs:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2120"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2121"><B>+nodsp</B><DD>


Disable the <FONT SIZE="-1">DSP</FONT> instructions on <B>cortex-m33</B>.
<DT id="2122"><B>+nofp</B><DD>


Disables the floating-point instructions on <B>arm9e</B>,

<B>cortex-a17.cortex-a7</B>, <B>cortex-a32</B>, <B>cortex-a35</B>,
<B>cortex-a53</B> and <B>cortex-a55</B>.
<DT id="2123"><B>+nofp.dp</B><DD>


Disables the double-precision component of the floating-point instructions
on <B>cortex-r5</B>, <B>cortex-r7</B>, <B>cortex-r8</B>, <B>cortex-r52</B> and
<B>cortex-m7</B>.
<DT id="2124"><B>+nosimd</B><DD>


Disables the <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> (but not floating-point) instructions on
<B>generic-armv7-a</B>, <B>cortex-a5</B>, <B>cortex-a7</B>
and <B>cortex-a9</B>.
<DT id="2125"><B>+crypto</B><DD>


Enables the cryptographic instructions on <B>cortex-a32</B>,
<B>cortex-a35</B>, <B>cortex-a53</B>, <B>cortex-a55</B>, <B>cortex-a57</B>,

<B>cortex-a73.cortex-a35</B>, <B>cortex-a73.cortex-a53</B> and
<B>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</B>.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="2126"><DD>


<P>


Additionally the <B>generic-armv7-a</B> pseudo target defaults to
VFPv3 with 16 double-precision registers.  It supports the following
extension options: <B>mp</B>, <B>sec</B>, <B>vfpv3-d16</B>,
<B>vfpv3</B>, <B>vfpv3-d16-fp16</B>, <B>vfpv3-fp16</B>,
<B>vfpv4-d16</B>, <B>vfpv4</B>, <B>neon</B>, <B>neon-vfpv3</B>,
<B>neon-fp16</B>, <B>neon-vfpv4</B>.  The meanings are the same as for
the extensions to <B>-march=armv7-a</B>.


<P>


<B>-mcpu=generic-</B><I>arch</I> is also permissible, and is
equivalent to <B>-march=</B><I>arch</I> <B>-mtune=generic-</B><I>arch</I>.
See <B>-mtune</B> for more information.


<P>


<B>-mcpu=native</B> causes the compiler to auto-detect the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect
is unsuccessful the option has no effect.
</DL>

<DT id="2127"><B>-mfpu=</B><I>name</I><DD>


This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: <B>auto</B>, <B>vfpv2</B>,
<B>vfpv3</B>,
<B>vfpv3-fp16</B>, <B>vfpv3-d16</B>, <B>vfpv3-d16-fp16</B>, <B>vfpv3xd</B>,
<B>vfpv3xd-fp16</B>, <B>neon-vfpv3</B>, <B>neon-fp16</B>, <B>vfpv4</B>,
<B>vfpv4-d16</B>, <B>fpv4-sp-d16</B>, <B>neon-vfpv4</B>,
<B>fpv5-d16</B>, <B>fpv5-sp-d16</B>,
<B>fp-armv8</B>, <B>neon-fp-armv8</B> and <B>crypto-neon-fp-armv8</B>.
Note that <B>neon</B> is an alias for <B>neon-vfpv3</B> and <B>vfp</B>
is an alias for <B>vfpv2</B>.


<P>


The setting <B>auto</B> is the default and is special.  It causes the
compiler to select the floating-point and Advanced <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> instructions
based on the settings of <B>-mcpu</B> and <B>-march</B>.


<P>


If the selected floating-point hardware includes the <FONT SIZE="-1">NEON</FONT> extension
(e.g. <B>-mfpu=neon</B>), note that floating-point
operations are not generated by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s auto-vectorization pass unless
<B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> is also specified.  This is
because <FONT SIZE="-1">NEON</FONT> hardware does not fully implement the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE 754</FONT> standard for
floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
zero), so the use of <FONT SIZE="-1">NEON</FONT> instructions may lead to a loss of precision.


<P>


You can also set the fpu name at function level by using the <TT>&quot;target(&quot;fpu=&quot;)&quot;</TT> function attributes or pragmas.
<DT id="2128"><B>-mfp16-format=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Specify the format of the <TT>&quot;__fp16&quot;</TT> half-precision floating-point type.
Permissible names are <B>none</B>, <B>ieee</B>, and <B>alternative</B>;
the default is <B>none</B>, in which case the <TT>&quot;__fp16&quot;</TT> type is not
defined.
<DT id="2129"><B>-mstructure-size-boundary=</B><I>n</I><DD>


The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the <FONT SIZE="-1">COFF</FONT>
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> supports it.


<P>


Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.


<P>


This option is deprecated.
<DT id="2130"><B>-mabort-on-noreturn</B><DD>


Generate a call to the function <TT>&quot;abort&quot;</TT> at the end of a
<TT>&quot;noreturn&quot;</TT> function.  It is executed if the function tries to
return.
<DT id="2131"><B>-mlong-calls</B><DD>



<DT id="2132"><B>-mno-long-calls</B><DD>



Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 64-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.


<P>


Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
that have the <TT>&quot;short_call&quot;</TT> attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a <TT>&quot;#pragma no_long_calls&quot;</TT> directive, and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this rule are
that weak function definitions, functions with the <TT>&quot;long_call&quot;</TT>
attribute or the <TT>&quot;section&quot;</TT> attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a <TT>&quot;#pragma long_calls&quot;</TT> directive are always
turned into long calls.


<P>


This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
<B>-mno-long-calls</B> restores the default behavior, as does
placing the function calls within the scope of a <TT>&quot;#pragma
long_calls_off&quot;</TT> directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.
<DT id="2133"><B>-msingle-pic-base</B><DD>


Treat the register used for <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The runtime system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.
<DT id="2134"><B>-mpic-register=</B><I>reg</I><DD>


Specify the register to be used for <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> addressing.
For standard <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> base case, the default is any suitable register
determined by compiler.  For single <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> base case, the default is
<B>R9</B> if target is <FONT SIZE="-1">EABI</FONT> based or stack-checking is enabled,
otherwise the default is <B>R10</B>.
<DT id="2135"><B>-mpic-data-is-text-relative</B><DD>


Assume that the displacement between the text and data segments is fixed
at static link time.  This permits using PC-relative addressing
operations to access data known to be in the data segment.  For
non-VxWorks <FONT SIZE="-1">RTP</FONT> targets, this option is enabled by default.  When
disabled on such targets, it will enable <B>-msingle-pic-base</B> by
default.
<DT id="2136"><B>-mpoke-function-name</B><DD>


Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:


<P>




<PRE>
             t0
                 .ascii &quot;arm_poke_function_name&quot;, 0
                 .align
             t1
                 .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
             arm_poke_function_name
                 mov     ip, sp
                 stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                 sub     fp, ip, #4

</PRE>




<P>


When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
<TT>&quot;pc&quot;</TT> stored at <TT>&quot;fp + 0&quot;</TT>.  If the trace function then looks at
location <TT>&quot;pc - 12&quot;</TT> and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length <TT>&quot;((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="2137"><B>-mthumb</B><DD>



<DT id="2138"><B>-marm</B><DD>



Select between generating code that executes in <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> and Thumb
states.  The default for most configurations is to generate code
that executes in <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> state, but the default can be changed by
configuring <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with the <B>--with-mode=</B><I>state</I>
configure option.


<P>


You can also override the <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> and Thumb mode for each function
by using the <TT>&quot;target(&quot;thumb&quot;)&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;target(&quot;arm&quot;)&quot;</TT> function attributes or pragmas.
<DT id="2139"><B>-mflip-thumb</B><DD>


Switch ARM/Thumb modes on alternating functions.
This option is provided for regression testing of mixed Thumb/ARM code
generation, and is not intended for ordinary use in compiling code.
<DT id="2140"><B>-mtpcs-frame</B><DD>


Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is <B>-mno-tpcs-frame</B>.
<DT id="2141"><B>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</B><DD>


Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is <B>-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</B>.
<DT id="2142"><B>-mcallee-super-interworking</B><DD>


Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT>
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.  This option is not valid in <FONT SIZE="-1">AAPCS</FONT> configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.
<DT id="2143"><B>-mcaller-super-interworking</B><DD>


Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.  This option
is not valid in <FONT SIZE="-1">AAPCS</FONT> configurations because interworking is enabled
by default.
<DT id="2144"><B>-mtp=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The valid
models are <B>soft</B>, which generates calls to <TT>&quot;__aeabi_read_tp&quot;</TT>,
<B>cp15</B>, which fetches the thread pointer from <TT>&quot;cp15&quot;</TT> directly
(supported in the arm6k architecture), and <B>auto</B>, which uses the
best available method for the selected processor.  The default setting is
<B>auto</B>.
<DT id="2145"><B>-mtls-dialect=</B><I>dialect</I><DD>


Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage.  Two
<I>dialect</I>s are supported---<B>gnu</B> and <B>gnu2</B>.  The
<B>gnu</B> dialect selects the original <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> scheme for supporting
local and global dynamic <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> models.  The <B>gnu2</B> dialect
selects the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> descriptor scheme, which provides better performance
for shared libraries.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> descriptor scheme is compatible with
the original scheme, but does require new assembler, linker and
library support.  Initial and local exec <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> models are unaffected by
this option and always use the original scheme.
<DT id="2146"><B>-mword-relocations</B><DD>


Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32).
This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime
loader imposes this restriction, and when <B>-fpic</B> or <B>-fPIC</B>
is specified. This option conflicts with <B>-mslow-flash-data</B>.
<DT id="2147"><B>-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd</B><DD>


Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when <TT>&quot;ldrd&quot;</TT> instructions
with overlapping destination and base registers are used.  This option avoids
generating these instructions.  This option is enabled by default when
<B>-mcpu=cortex-m3</B> is specified.
<DT id="2148"><B>-munaligned-access</B><DD>



<DT id="2149"><B>-mno-unaligned-access</B><DD>



Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16- and 32- bit values
from addresses that are not 16- or 32- bit aligned.  By default
unaligned access is disabled for all pre-ARMv6, all ARMv6-M and for
ARMv8-M Baseline architectures, and enabled for all other
architectures.  If unaligned access is not enabled then words in packed
data structures are accessed a byte at a time.


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">ARM</FONT> attribute <TT>&quot;Tag_CPU_unaligned_access&quot;</TT> is set in the
generated object file to either true or false, depending upon the
setting of this option.  If unaligned access is enabled then the
preprocessor symbol <TT>&quot;__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED&quot;</TT> is also
defined.
<DT id="2150"><B>-mneon-for-64bits</B><DD>


Enables using Neon to handle scalar 64-bits operations. This is
disabled by default since the cost of moving data from core registers
to Neon is high.
<DT id="2151"><B>-mslow-flash-data</B><DD>


Assume loading data from flash is slower than fetching instruction.
Therefore literal load is minimized for better performance.
This option is only supported when compiling for ARMv7 M-profile and
off by default. It conflicts with <B>-mword-relocations</B>.
<DT id="2152"><B>-masm-syntax-unified</B><DD>


Assume inline assembler is using unified asm syntax.  The default is
currently off which implies divided syntax.  This option has no impact
on Thumb2. However, this may change in future releases of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
Divided syntax should be considered deprecated.
<DT id="2153"><B>-mrestrict-it</B><DD>


Restricts generation of <FONT SIZE="-1">IT</FONT> blocks to conform to the rules of ARMv8-A.
<FONT SIZE="-1">IT</FONT> blocks can only contain a single 16-bit instruction from a select
set of instructions. This option is on by default for ARMv8-A Thumb mode.
<DT id="2154"><B>-mprint-tune-info</B><DD>


Print <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> tuning information as comment in assembler file.  This is
an option used only for regression testing of the compiler and not
intended for ordinary use in compiling code.  This option is disabled
by default.
<DT id="2155"><B>-mverbose-cost-dump</B><DD>


Enable verbose cost model dumping in the debug dump files.  This option is
provided for use in debugging the compiler.
<DT id="2156"><B>-mpure-code</B><DD>


Do not allow constant data to be placed in code sections.
Additionally, when compiling for <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> object format give all text sections the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> processor-specific section attribute <TT>&quot;SHF_ARM_PURECODE&quot;</TT>.  This option
is only available when generating non-pic code for M-profile targets.
<DT id="2157"><B>-mcmse</B><DD>


Generate secure code as per the ``ARMv8-M Security Extensions: Requirements on
Development Tools Engineering Specification'', which can be found on

Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release the needed
stack space for outgoing function arguments once in function
prologue/epilogue.  Without this option, outgoing arguments are pushed
before calling a function and popped afterwards.


<P>


Popping the arguments after the function call can be expensive on
<FONT SIZE="-1">AVR</FONT> so that accumulating the stack space might lead to smaller
executables because arguments need not be removed from the
stack after such a function call.


<P>


This option can lead to reduced code size for functions that perform
several calls to functions that get their arguments on the stack like
calls to printf-like functions.
<DT id="2180"><B>-mbranch-cost=</B><I>cost</I><DD>


Set the branch costs for conditional branch instructions to

<DT id="2183"><B>-mint8</B><DD>


Assume <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> to be 8-bit integer.  This affects the sizes of all types: a
<TT>&quot;char&quot;</TT> is 1 byte, an <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> is 1 byte, a <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT> is 2 bytes,
and <TT>&quot;long long&quot;</TT> is 4 bytes.  Please note that this option does not
conform to the C standards, but it results in smaller code
size.
<DT id="2184"><B>-mmain-is-OS_task</B><DD>


Do not save registers in <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>.  The effect is the same like
attaching attribute <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>AVR</B></FONT><B> Function Attributes,,</B>&quot;OS_task&quot;<B></B>

<DT id="2186"><B>-mno-interrupts</B><DD>


Generated code is not compatible with hardware interrupts.

Try to replace <TT>&quot;CALL&quot;</TT> resp. <TT>&quot;JMP&quot;</TT> instruction by the shorter
<TT>&quot;RCALL&quot;</TT> resp. <TT>&quot;RJMP&quot;</TT> instruction if applicable.
Setting <B>-mrelax</B> just adds the <B>--mlink-relax</B> option to
the assembler's command line and the <B>--relax</B> option to the
linker's command line.


<P>


Jump relaxing is performed by the linker because jump offsets are not
known before code is located. Therefore, the assembler code generated by the
compiler is the same, but the instructions in the executable may
differ from instructions in the assembler code.


<P>


Relaxing must be turned on if linker stubs are needed, see the
section on <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT> and linker stubs below.
<DT id="2188"><B>-mrmw</B><DD>

<DT id="2189"><B>-mshort-calls</B><DD>


Assume that <TT>&quot;RJMP&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;RCALL&quot;</TT> can target the whole
program memory.


<P>


This option is used internally for multilib selection.  It is
not an optimization option, and you don't need to set it by hand.
<DT id="2190"><B>-msp8</B><DD>


Treat the stack pointer register as an 8-bit register,
i.e. assume the high byte of the stack pointer is zero.
In general, you don't need to set this option by hand.


<P>


This option is used internally by the compiler to select and
build multilibs for architectures <TT>&quot;avr2&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;avr25&quot;</TT>.
These architectures mix devices with and without <TT>&quot;SPH&quot;</TT>.
For any setting other than <B>-mmcu=avr2</B> or <B>-mmcu=avr25</B>
the compiler driver adds or removes this option from the compiler
proper's command line, because the compiler then knows if the device
or architecture has an 8-bit stack pointer and thus no <TT>&quot;SPH&quot;</TT>
register or not.
<DT id="2191"><B>-mstrict-X</B><DD>


Use address register <TT>&quot;X&quot;</TT> in a way proposed by the hardware.  This means
that <TT>&quot;X&quot;</TT> is only used in indirect, post-increment or
pre-decrement addressing.


<P>


Without this option, the <TT>&quot;X&quot;</TT> register may be used in the same way
as <TT>&quot;Y&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;Z&quot;</TT> which then is emulated by additional
instructions.  
For example, loading a value with <TT>&quot;X+const&quot;</TT> addressing with a
small non-negative <TT>&quot;const &lt; 64&quot;</TT> to a register <I>Rn</I> is
performed as

<DT id="2195"><B>-nodevicespecs</B><DD>


Don't add <B>-specs=device-specs/specs-&lt;mcu&gt;</B> to the compiler driver's

like compiler proper, assembler and linker with appropriate command line
options.

<TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT> and Devices with More Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash


<P>

Pointers in the implementation are 16@tie{}bits wide.
The address of a function or label is represented as word address so
that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the
range of 64@tie{}Ki words.
<P>

In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128@tie{}Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called
<TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT> that serves as most significant part of the target address
when <TT>&quot;EICALL&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;EIJMP&quot;</TT> instructions are used.
<P>

Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by
the compiler and are subject to some limitations:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2198">*<DD>
The compiler never sets <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="2199">*<DD>
The compiler uses <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT> implicitly in <TT>&quot;EICALL&quot;</TT>/<TT>&quot;EIJMP&quot;</TT>
instructions or might read <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT> directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a <TT>&quot;RET&quot;</TT> instruction.
<DT id="2200">*<DD>
The compiler assumes that <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT> never changes during the startup
code or during the application. In particular, <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT> is not
saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
prologue/epilogue.
<DT id="2201">*<DD>
For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
generates <I>stubs</I>. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
<I>trampolines</I>. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.
The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.
<DT id="2202">*<DD>
Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker generates
the stubs correctly in all situations. See the compiler option
<B>-mrelax</B> and the linker option <B>--relax</B>.
There are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate stubs
but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful error message.
<DT id="2203">*<DD>
The default linker script is arranged for code with <TT>&quot;EIND = 0&quot;</TT>.
If code is supposed to work for a setup with <TT>&quot;EIND != 0&quot;</TT>, a custom
linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
name start with <TT>&quot;.trampolines&quot;</TT> into the segment where <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT>
points to.
<DT id="2204">*<DD>
The startup code from libgcc never sets <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT>.
Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC.
For the impact of AVR-LibC on <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT>, see the
AVR-LibC&nbsp;user&nbsp;manual (<TT>&quot;<A HREF="http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/">http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/</A>&quot;</TT>).
<DT id="2205">*<DD>
It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT>
early, for example by means of initialization code located in
section <TT>&quot;.init3&quot;</TT>. Such code runs prior to general startup code
that initializes <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> and calls constructors, but after the bit
of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets <TT>&quot;EIND&quot;</TT> to the segment
where the vector table is located.

Handling of the <TT>&quot;RAMPD&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;RAMPX&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;RAMPY&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;RAMPZ&quot;</TT> Special Function Registers


<P>

Some <FONT SIZE="-1">AVR</FONT> devices support memories larger than the 64@tie{}KiB range
that can be accessed with 16-bit pointers.  To access memory locations
outside this 64@tie{}KiB range, the content of a <TT>&quot;RAMP&quot;</TT>
register is used as high part of the address:
The <TT>&quot;X&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;Y&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;Z&quot;</TT> address register is concatenated
with the <TT>&quot;RAMPX&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;RAMPY&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;RAMPZ&quot;</TT> special function
register, respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,
<TT>&quot;RAMPD&quot;</TT> is used together with direct addressing.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2221">*<DD>
The startup code initializes the <TT>&quot;RAMP&quot;</TT> special function
registers with zero.
<DT id="2222">*<DD>
If a <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>AVR</B></FONT><B> Named Address Spaces,named address space</B> other than
generic or <TT>&quot;__flash&quot;</TT> is used, then <TT>&quot;RAMPZ&quot;</TT> is set
as needed before the operation.
<DT id="2223">*<DD>
If the device supports <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> larger than 64@tie{}KiB and the compiler
needs to change <TT>&quot;RAMPZ&quot;</TT> to accomplish an operation, <TT>&quot;RAMPZ&quot;</TT>
is reset to zero after the operation.
<DT id="2224">*<DD>
If the device comes with a specific <TT>&quot;RAMP&quot;</TT> register, the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISR</FONT>
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that <FONT SIZE="-1">SFR</FONT> and initializes it with
zero in case the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISR</FONT> code might (implicitly) use it.
<DT id="2225">*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> larger than 64@tie{}KiB is not supported by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> for <FONT SIZE="-1">AVR</FONT> targets.
If you use inline assembler to read from locations outside the
16-bit address range and change one of the <TT>&quot;RAMP&quot;</TT> registers,
you must reset it to zero after the access.

<FONT SIZE="-1">AVR</FONT> Built-in Macros


<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defines several built-in macros so that the user code can test
for the presence or absence of features.  Almost any of the following

If <I>mcu</I> specifies a device, this built-in macro is set
accordingly. For example, with <B>-mmcu=atmega8</B> the macro is
defined to <TT>4</TT>.
<DT id="2227">&quot;__AVR_<I>Device</I>__&quot;<DD>




Setting <B>-mmcu=</B><I>device</I> defines this built-in macro which reflects
the device's name. For example, <B>-mmcu=atmega8</B> defines the
built-in macro <TT>&quot;__AVR_ATmega8__&quot;</TT>, <B>-mmcu=attiny261a</B> defines
<TT>&quot;__AVR_ATtiny261A__&quot;</TT>, etc.

The built-in macros' names follow
the scheme <TT>&quot;__AVR_</TT>Device<TT>__&quot;</TT> where <I>Device</I> is
the device name as from the <FONT SIZE="-1">AVR</FONT> user manual. The difference between
<I>Device</I> in the built-in macro and <I>device</I> in
<B>-mmcu=</B><I>device</I> is that the latter is always lowercase.

The device has the <TT>&quot;EIJMP&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;EICALL&quot;</TT> instructions.
This is the case for devices with more than 128@tie{}KiB of program memory.
This also means that the program counter

Instructions that can address I/O special function registers directly
like <TT>&quot;IN&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;OUT&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;SBI&quot;</TT>, etc. may use a different
address as if addressed by an instruction to access <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> like <TT>&quot;LD&quot;</TT>
or <TT>&quot;STS&quot;</TT>. This offset depends on the device architecture and has
to be subtracted from the <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> address in order to get the
respective I/O@tie{}address.
<DT id="2252">&quot;__AVR_SHORT_CALLS__&quot;<DD>




The <B>-mshort-calls</B> command line option is set.
<DT id="2253">&quot;__AVR_PM_BASE_ADDRESS__=<I>addr</I>&quot;<DD>




Some devices support reading from flash memory by means of <TT>&quot;LD*&quot;</TT>
instructions.  The flash memory is seen in the data address space
at an offset of <TT>&quot;__AVR_PM_BASE_ADDRESS__&quot;</TT>.  If this macro

<B>bf561</B>, <B>bf592</B>.


<P>


The optional <I>sirevision</I> specifies the silicon revision of the target
Blackfin processor.  Any workarounds available for the targeted silicon revision
are enabled.  If <I>sirevision</I> is <B>none</B>, no workarounds are enabled.
If <I>sirevision</I> is <B>any</B>, all workarounds for the targeted processor
are enabled.  The <TT>&quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot;</TT> macro is defined to two
hexadecimal digits representing the major and minor numbers in the silicon
revision.  If <I>sirevision</I> is <B>none</B>, the <TT>&quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot;</TT>
is not defined.  If <I>sirevision</I> is <B>any</B>, the
<TT>&quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot;</TT> is defined to be <TT>0xffff</TT>.
If this optional <I>sirevision</I> is not used, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> assumes the latest known
silicon revision of the targeted Blackfin processor.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defines a preprocessor macro for the specified <I>cpu</I>.
For the <B>bfin-elf</B> toolchain, this option causes the hardware <FONT SIZE="-1">BSP</FONT>
provided by libgloss to be linked in if <B>-msim</B> is not given.


<P>


Without this option, <B>bf532</B> is used as the processor by default.


<P>


Note that support for <B>bf561</B> is incomplete.  For <B>bf561</B>,
only the preprocessor macro is defined.
<DT id="2256"><B>-msim</B><DD>


Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes
the simulator <FONT SIZE="-1">BSP</FONT> provided by libgloss to be linked in.  This option
has effect only for <B>bfin-elf</B> toolchain.
Certain other options, such as <B>-mid-shared-library</B> and
<B>-mfdpic</B>, imply <B>-msim</B>.
<DT id="2257"><B>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</B><DD>


Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This
avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.
<DT id="2258"><B>-mspecld-anomaly</B><DD>


When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not
contain speculative loads after jump instructions. If this option is used,
<TT>&quot;__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS&quot;</TT> is defined.
<DT id="2259"><B>-mno-specld-anomaly</B><DD>


Don't generate extra code to prevent speculative loads from occurring.
<DT id="2260"><B>-mcsync-anomaly</B><DD>


When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not
contain <FONT SIZE="-1">CSYNC</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">SSYNC</FONT> instructions too soon after conditional branches.
If this option is used, <TT>&quot;__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS&quot;</TT> is defined.
<DT id="2261"><B>-mno-csync-anomaly</B><DD>


Don't generate extra code to prevent <FONT SIZE="-1">CSYNC</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">SSYNC</FONT> instructions from
occurring too soon after a conditional branch.
<DT id="2262"><B>-mlow64k</B><DD>


When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the knowledge that
the entire program fits into the low 64k of memory.
<DT id="2263"><B>-mno-low64k</B><DD>


Assume that the program is arbitrarily large.  This is the default.
<DT id="2264"><B>-mstack-check-l1</B><DD>


Do stack checking using information placed into L1 scratchpad memory by the
uClinux kernel.
<DT id="2265"><B>-mid-shared-library</B><DD>


Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> method.
This allows for execute in place and shared libraries in an environment
without virtual memory management.  This option implies <B>-fPIC</B>.
With a <B>bfin-elf</B> target, this option implies <B>-msim</B>.
<DT id="2266"><B>-mno-id-shared-library</B><DD>


Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are being used.
This is the default.
<DT id="2267"><B>-mleaf-id-shared-library</B><DD>


Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> method,
but assumes that this library or executable won't link against any other
<FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> shared libraries.  That allows the compiler to use faster code for jumps
and calls.
<DT id="2268"><B>-mno-leaf-id-shared-library</B><DD>


Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against any <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> shared
libraries.  Slower code is generated for jump and call insns.
<DT id="2269"><B>-mshared-library-id=n</B><DD>


Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying
other values forces the allocation of that number to the current
library but is no more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.
<DT id="2270"><B>-msep-data</B><DD>


Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute in place in
an environment without virtual memory management by eliminating relocations
against the text section.
<DT id="2271"><B>-mno-sep-data</B><DD>


Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.
This is the default.
<DT id="2272"><B>-mlong-calls</B><DD>



<DT id="2273"><B>-mno-long-calls</B><DD>



Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 24-bit addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.


<P>


This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
<B>-mno-long-calls</B> restores the default behavior.  Note these
switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle
function calls via function pointers.
<DT id="2274"><B>-mfast-fp</B><DD>


Link with the fast floating-point library. This library relaxes some of
the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> floating-point standard's rules for checking inputs against
Not-a-Number (<FONT SIZE="-1">NAN</FONT>), in the interest of performance.
<DT id="2275"><B>-minline-plt</B><DD>


Enable inlining of <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> entries in function calls to functions that are
not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without <B>-mfdpic</B>.
<DT id="2276"><B>-mmulticore</B><DD>


Build a standalone application for multicore Blackfin processors. 
This option causes proper start files and link scripts supporting 
multicore to be used, and defines the macro <TT>&quot;__BFIN_MULTICORE&quot;</TT>. 
It can only be used with <B>-mcpu=bf561</B>[<B>-</B><I>sirevision</I>].


<P>


This option can be used with <B>-mcorea</B> or <B>-mcoreb</B>, which
selects the one-application-per-core programming model.  Without
<B>-mcorea</B> or <B>-mcoreb</B>, the single-application/dual-core
programming model is used. In this model, the main function of Core B
should be named as <TT>&quot;coreb_main&quot;</TT>.


<P>


If this option is not used, the single-core application programming
model is used.
<DT id="2277"><B>-mcorea</B><DD>


Build a standalone application for Core A of <FONT SIZE="-1">BF561</FONT> when using
the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper start files
and link scripts are used to support Core A, and the macro
<TT>&quot;__BFIN_COREA&quot;</TT> is defined.
This option can only be used in conjunction with <B>-mmulticore</B>.
<DT id="2278"><B>-mcoreb</B><DD>


Build a standalone application for Core B of <FONT SIZE="-1">BF561</FONT> when using
the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper start files
and link scripts are used to support Core B, and the macro
<TT>&quot;__BFIN_COREB&quot;</TT> is defined. When this option is used, <TT>&quot;coreb_main&quot;</TT>
should be used instead of <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>. 
This option can only be used in conjunction with <B>-mmulticore</B>.
<DT id="2279"><B>-msdram</B><DD>


Build a standalone application for <FONT SIZE="-1">SDRAM.</FONT> Proper start files and
link scripts are used to put the application into <FONT SIZE="-1">SDRAM,</FONT> and the macro
<TT>&quot;__BFIN_SDRAM&quot;</TT> is defined.
The loader should initialize <FONT SIZE="-1">SDRAM</FONT> before loading the application.
<DT id="2280"><B>-micplb</B><DD>


Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at run time.  This has an effect on certain

<P>

<I>Darwin Options</I>


<P>

These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">FSF GCC</FONT> on Darwin does not create ``fat'' object files; it creates
an object file for the single architecture that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was built to
target.  Apple's <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> on Darwin does create ``fat'' files if multiple
<B>-arch</B> options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
<I>lipo</I>.
<P>

The subtype of the file created (like <B>ppc7400</B> or <B>ppc970</B> or
<B>i686</B>) is determined by the flags that specify the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT>
that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is targeting, like <B>-mcpu</B> or <B>-march</B>.  The
<B>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</B> option can be used to override this.
<P>

The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT>
mismatch.  The assembler, <I>as</I>, only permits instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64-bit instructions in a <B>ppc750</B> object file.
The linker for shared libraries, <I>/usr/bin/libtool</I>, fails
and prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a <B>ppc970</B> object file in a <B>ppc7400</B> library).  The linker
for executables, <B>ld</B>, quietly gives the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2371"><B>-F</B><I>dir</I><DD>


Add the framework directory <I>dir</I> to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by <B>-I</B> options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.


<P>


A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a <I>Headers</I> and/or
<I>PrivateHeaders</I> directory contained directly in it that ends
in <I>.framework</I>.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the <I>.framework</I>.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
<I>Headers</I> being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's <I>Frameworks</I> directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework; a warning is issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in <I>/System/Library/Frameworks</I> and
<I>/Library/Frameworks</I>.  An example include looks like
<TT>&quot;#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/Framework/header.h">Framework/header.h</A>&gt;&quot;</TT>, where <I>Framework</I> denotes
the name of the framework and <I>header.h</I> is found in the
<I>PrivateHeaders</I> or <I>Headers</I> directory.
<DT id="2372"><B>-iframework</B><I>dir</I><DD>


Like <B>-F</B> except the directory is a treated as a system
directory.  The main difference between this <B>-iframework</B> and
<B>-F</B> is that with <B>-iframework</B> the compiler does not
warn about constructs contained within header files found via
<I>dir</I>.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.
<DT id="2373"><B>-gused</B><DD>


Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For stabs
debugging format, this enables <B>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</B>.
This is by default <FONT SIZE="-1">ON.</FONT>
<DT id="2374"><B>-gfull</B><DD>


Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.
<DT id="2375"><B>-mmacosx-version-min=</B><I>version</I><DD>


The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on
is <I>version</I>.  Typical values of <I>version</I> include <TT>10.1</TT>,
<TT>10.2</TT>, and <TT>10.3.9</TT>.


<P>


If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
then the default for this option is the system version on which the
compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices that
are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.
<DT id="2376"><B>-mkernel</B><DD>


Enable kernel development mode.  The <B>-mkernel</B> option sets
<B>-static</B>, <B>-fno-common</B>, <B>-fno-use-cxa-atexit</B>,
<B>-fno-exceptions</B>, <B>-fno-non-call-exceptions</B>,
<B>-fapple-kext</B>, <B>-fno-weak</B> and <B>-fno-rtti</B> where
applicable.  This mode also sets <B>-mno-altivec</B>,
<B>-msoft-float</B>, <B>-fno-builtin</B> and
<B>-mlong-branch</B> for PowerPC targets.
<DT id="2377"><B>-mone-byte-bool</B><DD>


Override the defaults for <TT>&quot;bool&quot;</TT> so that <TT>&quot;sizeof(bool)==1&quot;</TT>.
By default <TT>&quot;sizeof(bool)&quot;</TT> is <TT>4</TT> when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and <TT>1</TT> when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
option has no effect on x86.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> The <B>-mone-byte-bool</B> switch causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all
other modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this

</DL>
<P>

<I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>DEC</I></FONT><I> Alpha Options</I>


<P>

These <B>-m</B> options are defined for the <FONT SIZE="-1">DEC</FONT> Alpha implementations:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2446"><B>-mno-soft-float</B><DD>



<DT id="2447"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>



Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When <B>-msoft-float</B> is specified,
functions in <I>libgcc.a</I> are used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.


<P>


Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.
<DT id="2448"><B>-mfp-reg</B><DD>



<DT id="2449"><B>-mno-fp-regs</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
<B>-mno-fp-regs</B> implies <B>-msoft-float</B>.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in <TT>$0</TT> instead of <TT>$f0</TT>.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with <B>-mno-fp-regs</B> must also be compiled with that
option.


<P>


A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
<DT id="2450"><B>-mieee</B><DD>


The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> floating-point
standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code
<I>except</I> that the <I>inexact-flag</I> is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro <TT>&quot;_IEEE_FP&quot;</TT> is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT>
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option <B>-ieee_with_no_inexact</B>.
<DT id="2451"><B>-mieee-with-inexact</B><DD>


This is like <B>-mieee</B> except the generated code also maintains
the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> <I>inexact-flag</I>.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> math.  In addition to
<TT>&quot;_IEEE_FP&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;_IEEE_FP_EXACT&quot;</TT> is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the <I>inexact-flag</I>, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option <B>-ieee_with_inexact</B>.
<DT id="2452"><B>-mfp-trap-mode=</B><I>trap-mode</I><DD>


This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.
Other Alpha compilers call this option <B>-fptm</B> <I>trap-mode</I>.
The trap mode can be set to one of four values:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2453"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2454"><B>n</B><DD>


This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).
<DT id="2455"><B>u</B><DD>


In addition to the traps enabled by <B>n</B>, underflow traps are enabled
as well.
<DT id="2456"><B>su</B><DD>


Like <B>u</B>, but the instructions are marked to be safe for software
completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).
<DT id="2457"><B>sui</B><DD>


Like <B>su</B>, but inexact traps are enabled as well.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="2458"><DD>
</DL>

<DT id="2459"><B>-mfp-rounding-mode=</B><I>rounding-mode</I><DD>


Selects the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
<B>-fprm</B> <I>rounding-mode</I>.  The <I>rounding-mode</I> can be one
of:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2460"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2461"><B>n</B><DD>


Normal <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.
<DT id="2462"><B>m</B><DD>


Round towards minus infinity.
<DT id="2463"><B>c</B><DD>


Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.
<DT id="2464"><B>d</B><DD>


Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control register
(<I>fpcr</I>, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
<I>fpcr</I>, <B>d</B> corresponds to round towards plus infinity.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="2465"><DD>
</DL>

<DT id="2466"><B>-mtrap-precision=</B><I>trap-precision</I><DD>


In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated.
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating-point trap.
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2467"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2468"><B>p</B><DD>


Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating-point exception.
<DT id="2469"><B>f</B><DD>


Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating-point exception.
<DT id="2470"><B>i</B><DD>


Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating-point exception.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="2471"><DD>


<P>


Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
<B>-scope_safe</B> and <B>-resumption_safe</B>.
</DL>

<DT id="2472"><B>-mieee-conformant</B><DD>


This option marks the generated code as <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify <B>-mtrap-precision=i</B> and either
<B>-mfp-trap-mode=su</B> or <B>-mfp-trap-mode=sui</B>.  Its only effect
is to emit the line <B>.eflag 48</B> in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.
<DT id="2473"><B>-mbuild-constants</B><DD>


Normally <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal and
generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.


<P>


Use this option to require <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to construct <I>all</I> integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).


<P>


You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.
<DT id="2474"><B>-mbwx</B><DD>



<DT id="2475"><B>-mno-bwx</B><DD>


<DT id="2476"><B>-mcix</B><DD>


<DT id="2477"><B>-mno-cix</B><DD>


<DT id="2478"><B>-mfix</B><DD>


<DT id="2479"><B>-mno-fix</B><DD>


<DT id="2480"><B>-mmax</B><DD>


<DT id="2481"><B>-mno-max</B><DD>



Indicate whether <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> should generate code to use the optional <FONT SIZE="-1">BWX,
CIX, FIX</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">MAX</FONT> instruction sets.  The default is to use the instruction
sets supported by the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> type specified via <B>-mcpu=</B> option or that
of the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> on which <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was built if none is specified.
<DT id="2482"><B>-mfloat-vax</B><DD>



<DT id="2483"><B>-mfloat-ieee</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) <FONT SIZE="-1">VAX F</FONT> and G floating-point
arithmetic instead of <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> single and double precision.
<DT id="2484"><B>-mexplicit-relocs</B><DD>



<DT id="2485"><B>-mno-explicit-relocs</B><DD>



Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option
is mostly useful for debugging, as <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> detects the capabilities of
the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.
<DT id="2486"><B>-msmall-data</B><DD>



<DT id="2487"><B>-mlarge-data</B><DD>



When <B>-mexplicit-relocs</B> is in effect, static data is
accessed via <I>gp-relative</I> relocations.  When <B>-msmall-data</B>
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a <I>small data area</I>
(the <TT>&quot;.sdata&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;.sbss&quot;</TT> sections) and are accessed via
16-bit relocations off of the <TT>$gp</TT> register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.


<P>


The default is <B>-mlarge-data</B>.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use <TT>&quot;malloc&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;mmap&quot;</TT> to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.


<P>


When generating code for shared libraries, <B>-fpic</B> implies
<B>-msmall-data</B> and <B>-fPIC</B> implies <B>-mlarge-data</B>.
<DT id="2488"><B>-msmall-text</B><DD>



<DT id="2489"><B>-mlarge-text</B><DD>



When <B>-msmall-text</B> is used, the compiler assumes that the
code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is
thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When <B>-msmall-data</B>
is used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the
same <TT>$gp</TT> value, and thus reduce the number of instructions
required for a function call from 4 to 1.


<P>


The default is <B>-mlarge-text</B>.
<DT id="2490"><B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I><DD>


Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for
machine type <I>cpu_type</I>.  You can specify either the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>EV</B></FONT><B></B>
style name or the corresponding chip number.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports scheduling
parameters for the <FONT SIZE="-1">EV4, EV5</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">EV6</FONT> family of processors and
chooses the default values for the instruction set from the processor
you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults
to the processor on which the compiler was built.


<P>


Supported values for <I>cpu_type</I> are

Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical memory

<DT id="2539"><B>-mno-muladd</B><DD>


Do not use multiply and add/subtract instructions.
<DT id="2540"><B>-mfdpic</B><DD>


Select the <FONT SIZE="-1">FDPIC ABI,</FONT> which uses function descriptors to represent
pointers to functions.  Without any PIC/PIE-related options, it
implies <B>-fPIE</B>.  With <B>-fpic</B> or <B>-fpie</B>, it
assumes <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries and small data are within a 12-bit range from the
<FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> base address; with <B>-fPIC</B> or <B>-fPIE</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> offsets
are computed with 32 bits.
With a <B>bfin-elf</B> target, this option implies <B>-msim</B>.
<DT id="2541"><B>-minline-plt</B><DD>


Enable inlining of <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> entries in function calls to functions that are
not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without <B>-mfdpic</B>.
It's enabled by default if optimizing for speed and compiling for
shared libraries (i.e., <B>-fPIC</B> or <B>-fpic</B>), or when an

<DT id="2542"><B>-mTLS</B><DD>

Enable the use of <TT>&quot;GPREL&quot;</TT> relocations in the <FONT SIZE="-1">FDPIC ABI</FONT> for data
that is known to be in read-only sections.  It's enabled by default,
except for <B>-fpic</B> or <B>-fpie</B>: even though it may help
make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for 4.
With <B>-fPIC</B> or <B>-fPIE</B>, it trades 3 instructions for 4,
one of which may be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need
for a <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entry for the referenced symbol, so it's more likely to be a
win.  If it is not, <B>-mno-gprel-ro</B> can be used to disable it.
<DT id="2545"><B>-multilib-library-pic</B><DD>


Link with the (library, not <FONT SIZE="-1">FD</FONT>) pic libraries.  It's implied by

<P>


When compiling, this option enables <B>-mbionic</B>, <B>-fPIC</B>,
<B>-fno-exceptions</B> and <B>-fno-rtti</B> by default.  When linking,
this option makes the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver pass Android-specific options to the linker.
Finally, this option causes the preprocessor macro <TT>&quot;__ANDROID__&quot;</TT>
to be defined.
<DT id="2576"><B>-tno-android-cc</B><DD>

These <B>-m</B> options are defined for the <FONT SIZE="-1">HPPA</FONT> family of computers:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2587"><B>-march=</B><I>architecture-type</I><DD>


Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
<I>architecture-type</I> are <B>1.0</B> for <FONT SIZE="-1">PA 1.0,</FONT> <B>1.1</B> for <FONT SIZE="-1">PA

<I>/usr/lib/sched.models</I> on an HP-UX system to determine the proper
architecture option for your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered
architectures runs on higher numbered architectures, but not the
other way around.
<DT id="2588"><B>-mpa-risc-1-0</B><DD>



<DT id="2589"><B>-mpa-risc-1-1</B><DD>


<DT id="2590"><B>-mpa-risc-2-0</B><DD>



Synonyms for <B>-march=1.0</B>, <B>-march=1.1</B>, and <B>-march=2.0</B> respectively.
<DT id="2591"><B>-mcaller-copies</B><DD>


The caller copies function arguments passed by hidden reference.  This
option should be used with care as it is not compatible with the default
32-bit runtime.  However, only aggregates larger than eight bytes are
passed by hidden reference and the option provides better compatibility
with OpenMP.
<DT id="2592"><B>-mjump-in-delay</B><DD>


This option is ignored and provided for compatibility purposes only.
<DT id="2593"><B>-mdisable-fpregs</B><DD>


Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels that perform lazy context switching of
floating-point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.
<DT id="2594"><B>-mdisable-indexing</B><DD>


Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling <FONT SIZE="-1">MIG</FONT> generated code under <FONT SIZE="-1">MACH.</FONT>
<DT id="2595"><B>-mno-space-regs</B><DD>


Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.


<P>


Such code is suitable for level 0 <FONT SIZE="-1">PA</FONT> systems and kernels.
<DT id="2596"><B>-mfast-indirect-calls</B><DD>


Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.  This
allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to emit code that performs faster indirect calls.


<P>


This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested
functions.
<DT id="2597"><B>-mfixed-range=</B><I>register-range</I><DD>


Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
<DT id="2598"><B>-mlong-load-store</B><DD>


Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the <B>+k</B> option to
the <FONT SIZE="-1">HP</FONT> compilers.
<DT id="2599"><B>-mportable-runtime</B><DD>


Use the portable calling conventions proposed by <FONT SIZE="-1">HP</FONT> for <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> systems.
<DT id="2600"><B>-mgas</B><DD>


Enable the use of assembler directives only <FONT SIZE="-1">GAS</FONT> understands.
<DT id="2601"><B>-mschedule=</B><I>cpu-type</I><DD>


Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
<I>cpu-type</I>.  The choices for <I>cpu-type</I> are <B>700</B>
<B>7100</B>, <B>7100LC</B>, <B>7200</B>, <B>7300</B> and <B>8000</B>.  Refer
to <I>/usr/lib/sched.models</I> on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is
<B>8000</B>.
<DT id="2602"><B>-mlinker-opt</B><DD>


Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.
<DT id="2603"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>


Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<B>Warning:</B> the requisite libraries are not available for all <FONT SIZE="-1">HPPA</FONT>
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.


<P>


<B>-msoft-float</B> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <I>all</I> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <I>libgcc.a</I>, the
library that comes with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> with <B>-msoft-float</B> in order for
this to work.
<DT id="2604"><B>-msio</B><DD>


Generate the predefine, <TT>&quot;_SIO&quot;</TT>, for server <FONT SIZE="-1">IO.</FONT>  The default is
<B>-mwsio</B>.  This generates the predefines, <TT>&quot;__hp9000s700&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;__hp9000s700__&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;_WSIO&quot;</TT>, for workstation <FONT SIZE="-1">IO.</FONT>  These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.
<DT id="2605"><B>-mgnu-ld</B><DD>


Use options specific to <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> <B>ld</B>.
This passes <B>-shared</B> to <B>ld</B> when
building a shared library.  It is the default when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker.  This option does not
affect which <B>ld</B> is called; it only changes what parameters
are passed to that <B>ld</B>.
The <B>ld</B> that is called is determined by the
<B>--with-ld</B> configure option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s program search path, and
finally by the user's <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B>.  The linker used by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can be printed
using <B>which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</B>.  This option is only available
on the 64-bit HP-UX <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> i.e. configured with <B>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</B>.
<DT id="2606"><B>-mhp-ld</B><DD>


Use options specific to <FONT SIZE="-1">HP</FONT> <B>ld</B>.
This passes <B>-b</B> to <B>ld</B> when building
a shared library and passes <B>+Accept TypeMismatch</B> to <B>ld</B> on all
links.  It is the default when <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the <FONT SIZE="-1">HP</FONT> linker.  This option does not affect
which <B>ld</B> is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that
<B>ld</B>.
The <B>ld</B> that is called is determined by the <B>--with-ld</B>
configure option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s program search path, and finally by the user's
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B>.  The linker used by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can be printed using <B>which
`gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</B>.  This option is only available on the 64-bit
HP-UX <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> i.e. configured with <B>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</B>.
<DT id="2607"><B>-mlong-calls</B><DD>


Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
<FONT SIZE="-1">PA 2.0</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">PA 1.X</FONT> architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.


<P>


Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
<B>-ffunction-sections</B> option, or when using the <B>-mgas</B>
and <B>-mno-portable-runtime</B> options together under HP-UX with
the <FONT SIZE="-1">SOM</FONT> linker.


<P>


It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.


<P>


The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit <FONT SIZE="-1">ELF</FONT> systems in pic code
and it is quite long.
<DT id="2608"><B>-munix=</B><I>unix-std</I><DD>


Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
<FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> standard.  The choices for <I>unix-std</I> are <B>93</B>, <B>95</B>
and <B>98</B>.  <B>93</B> is supported on all HP-UX versions.  <B>95</B>
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  <B>98</B> is available on HP-UX
11.11 and later.  The default values are <B>93</B> for HP-UX 10.00,
<B>95</B> for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and <B>98</B> for HP-UX 11.11
and later.


<P>


<B>-munix=93</B> provides the same predefines as <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 3.3</FONT> and 3.4.
<B>-munix=95</B> provides additional predefines for <TT>&quot;XOPEN_UNIX&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;</TT>, and the startfile <I>unix95.o</I>.
<B>-munix=98</B> provides additional predefines for <TT>&quot;_XOPEN_UNIX&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500&quot;</TT>, and the startfile <I>unix98.o</I>.


<P>


It is <I>important</I> to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, <I>extreme</I> care is needed in using this
option.


<P>


Library code that is intended to operate with more than one <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT>
standard must test, set and restore the variable <TT>&quot;__xpg4_extended_mask&quot;</TT>
as appropriate.  Most <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> software doesn't provide this capability.
<DT id="2609"><B>-nolibdld</B><DD>


Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
<B>-static</B> option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.
<DT id="2610"><B>-static</B><DD>


The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the <B>-static</B> option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.


<P>


On HP-UX 10 and later, the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the <B>-static</B> option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
<B>-nolibdld</B> option can be used to prevent the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> driver from
adding these link options.
<DT id="2611"><B>-threads</B><DD>


Add support for multithreading with the <I>dce thread</I> library
under HP-UX.  This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and

<DT id="2648"><B>-msched-br-data-spec</B><DD>



(Dis/En)able data speculative scheduling before reload.
This results in generation of <TT>&quot;ld.a&quot;</TT> instructions and
the corresponding check instructions (<TT>&quot;ld.c&quot;</TT> / <TT>&quot;chk.a&quot;</TT>).
The default setting is disabled.
<DT id="2649"><B>-msched-ar-data-spec</B><DD>



<DT id="2650"><B>-mno-sched-ar-data-spec</B><DD>



(En/Dis)able data speculative scheduling after reload.
This results in generation of <TT>&quot;ld.a&quot;</TT> instructions and
the corresponding check instructions (<TT>&quot;ld.c&quot;</TT> / <TT>&quot;chk.a&quot;</TT>).
The default setting is enabled.
<DT id="2651"><B>-mno-sched-control-spec</B><DD>



<DT id="2652"><B>-msched-control-spec</B><DD>



(Dis/En)able control speculative scheduling.  This feature is
available only during region scheduling (i.e. before reload).
This results in generation of the <TT>&quot;ld.s&quot;</TT> instructions and
the corresponding check instructions <TT>&quot;chk.s&quot;</TT>.
The default setting is disabled.
<DT id="2653"><B>-msched-br-in-data-spec</B><DD>



<DT id="2654"><B>-mno-sched-br-in-data-spec</B><DD>



(En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that

This is effective only with <B>-msched-br-data-spec</B> enabled.
The default setting is enabled.
<DT id="2655"><B>-msched-ar-in-data-spec</B><DD>



<DT id="2656"><B>-mno-sched-ar-in-data-spec</B><DD>



(En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that

<DT id="2659"><B>-mno-sched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns</B><DD>



<DT id="2660"><B>-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns</B><DD>



If enabled, data-speculative instructions are chosen for schedule
only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This makes
the use of the data speculation much more conservative.
The default setting is disabled.
<DT id="2661"><B>-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns</B><DD>



<DT id="2662"><B>-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns</B><DD>



If enabled, control-speculative instructions are chosen for schedule
only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This makes
the use of the control speculation much more conservative.
The default setting is disabled.
<DT id="2663"><B>-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path</B><DD>



<DT id="2664"><B>-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path</B><DD>



If enabled, speculative dependencies are considered during
computation of the instructions priorities.  This makes the use of the
speculation a bit more conservative.
The default setting is disabled.
<DT id="2665"><B>-msched-spec-ldc</B><DD>


Use a simple data speculation check.  This option is on by default.
<DT id="2666"><B>-msched-control-spec-ldc</B><DD>

This flag is disabled by default.
<DT id="2670"><B>-msched-max-memory-insns=</B><I>max-insns</I><DD>


Limit on the number of memory insns per instruction group, giving lower
priority to subsequent memory insns attempting to schedule in the same
instruction group. Frequently useful to prevent cache bank conflicts.
The default value is 1.
<DT id="2671"><B>-msched-max-memory-insns-hard-limit</B><DD>


Makes the limit specified by <B>msched-max-memory-insns</B> a hard limit,
disallowing more than that number in an instruction group.
Otherwise, the limit is ``soft'', meaning that non-memory operations
are preferred when the limit is reached, but memory operations may still
be scheduled.

<I>M32C Options</I>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2677"><B>-mcpu=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Select the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> for which code is generated.  <I>name</I> may be one of
<B>r8c</B> for the R8C/Tiny series, <B>m16c</B> for the M16C (up to
/60) series, <B>m32cm</B> for the M16C/80 series, or <B>m32c</B> for
the M32C/80 series.
<DT id="2678"><B>-msim</B><DD>


Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes
an alternate runtime library to be linked in which supports, for
example, file I/O.  You must not use this option when generating
programs that will run on real hardware; you must provide your own
runtime library for whatever I/O functions are needed.
<DT id="2679"><B>-memregs=</B><I>number</I><DD>


Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses
during code generation.  These pseudo-registers are used like real
registers, so there is a tradeoff between <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s ability to fit the
code into available registers, and the performance penalty of using
memory instead of registers.  Note that all modules in a program must
be compiled with the same value for this option.  Because of that, you
must not use this option with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s default runtime libraries.
</DL>
<P>

<I>M32R/D Options</I>


<P>

These <B>-m</B> options are defined for Renesas M32R/D architectures:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2680"><B>-m32r2</B><DD>


Generate code for the M32R/2.
<DT id="2681"><B>-m32rx</B><DD>


Generate code for the M32R/X.
<DT id="2682"><B>-m32r</B><DD>


Generate code for the M32R.  This is the default.
<DT id="2683"><B>-mmodel=small</B><DD>


Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their addresses
can be loaded with the <TT>&quot;ld24&quot;</TT> instruction), and assume all subroutines
are reachable with the <TT>&quot;bl&quot;</TT> instruction.
This is the default.


<P>


The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
<TT>&quot;model&quot;</TT> attribute.
<DT id="2684"><B>-mmodel=medium</B><DD>


Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the compiler
generates <TT>&quot;seth/add3&quot;</TT> instructions to load their addresses), and
assume all subroutines are reachable with the <TT>&quot;bl&quot;</TT> instruction.
<DT id="2685"><B>-mmodel=large</B><DD>


Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the compiler
generates <TT>&quot;seth/add3&quot;</TT> instructions to load their addresses), and
assume subroutines may not be reachable with the <TT>&quot;bl&quot;</TT> instruction
(the compiler generates the much slower <TT>&quot;seth/add3/jl&quot;</TT>
instruction sequence).
<DT id="2686"><B>-msdata=none</B><DD>


Disable use of the small data area.  Variables are put into
one of <TT>&quot;.data&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;.bss&quot;</TT>, or <TT>&quot;.rodata&quot;</TT> (unless the
<TT>&quot;section&quot;</TT> attribute has been specified).
This is the default.


<P>


The small data area consists of sections <TT>&quot;.sdata&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;.sbss&quot;</TT>.
Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
<TT>&quot;section&quot;</TT> attribute using one of these sections.
<DT id="2687"><B>-msdata=sdata</B><DD>


Put small global and static data in the small data area, but do not
generate special code to reference them.
<DT id="2688"><B>-msdata=use</B><DD>


Put small global and static data in the small data area, and generate
special instructions to reference them.
<DT id="2689"><B>-G</B> <I>num</I><DD>


Put global and static objects less than or equal to <I>num</I> bytes
into the small data or <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> sections instead of the normal data or <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT>
sections.  The default value of <I>num</I> is 8.
The <B>-msdata</B> option must be set to one of <B>sdata</B> or <B>use</B>
for this option to have any effect.


<P>


All modules should be compiled with the same <B>-G</B> <I>num</I> value.
Compiling with different values of <I>num</I> may or may not work; if it
doesn't the linker gives an error message---incorrect code is not
generated.
<DT id="2690"><B>-mdebug</B><DD>


Makes the M32R-specific code in the compiler display some statistics
that might help in debugging programs.
<DT id="2691"><B>-malign-loops</B><DD>


Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.
<DT id="2692"><B>-mno-align-loops</B><DD>


Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for loops.  This is the default.
<DT id="2693"><B>-missue-rate=</B><I>number</I><DD>


Issue <I>number</I> instructions per cycle.  <I>number</I> can only be 1
or 2.
<DT id="2694"><B>-mbranch-cost=</B><I>number</I><DD>


<I>number</I> can only be 1 or 2.  If it is 1 then branches are
preferred over conditional code, if it is 2, then the opposite applies.
<DT id="2695"><B>-mflush-trap=</B><I>number</I><DD>


Specifies the trap number to use to flush the cache.  The default is
12.  Valid numbers are between 0 and 15 inclusive.

Specifies that the cache cannot be flushed by using a trap.
<DT id="2697"><B>-mflush-func=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Specifies the name of the operating system function to call to flush
the cache.  The default is <B>_flush_cache</B>, but a function call
is only used if a trap is not available.

are given below.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2699"><B>-march=</B><I>arch</I><DD>


Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire instruction set

<B>isab</B> and <B>isac</B>.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defines a macro <TT>&quot;__mcf</TT>arch<TT>__&quot;</TT> whenever it is generating

<DT id="2743"><B>-m68020-40</B><DD>


Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new instructions.
This results in code that can run relatively efficiently on either a
68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The generated code does use the
68881 instructions that are emulated on the 68040.

Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new instructions.
This results in code that can run relatively efficiently on either a

<DT id="2746"><B>-m68881</B><DD>



Generate floating-point instructions.  This is the default for 68020
and above, and for ColdFire devices that have an <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU.</FONT>  It defines the
macro <TT>&quot;__HAVE_68881__&quot;</TT> on M680x0 targets and <TT>&quot;__mcffpu__&quot;</TT>
on ColdFire targets.
<DT id="2747"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>


Do not generate floating-point instructions; use library calls instead.
This is the default for 68000, 68010, and 68832 targets.  It is also

<DT id="2748"><B>-mdiv</B><DD>



<DT id="2749"><B>-mno-div</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) ColdFire hardware divide and remainder
instructions.  If <B>-march</B> is used without <B>-mcpu</B>,
the default is ``on'' for ColdFire architectures and ``off'' for M680x0
architectures.  Otherwise, the default is taken from the target <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>
(either the default <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU,</FONT> or the one specified by <B>-mcpu</B>).  For
example, the default is ``off'' for <B>-mcpu=5206</B> and ``on'' for
<B>-mcpu=5206e</B>.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defines the macro <TT>&quot;__mcfhwdiv__&quot;</TT> when this option is enabled.
<DT id="2750"><B>-mshort</B><DD>


Consider type <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> to be 16 bits wide, like <TT>&quot;short int&quot;</TT>.
Additionally, parameters passed on the stack are also aligned to a
16-bit boundary even on targets whose <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT> mandates promotion to 32-bit.
<DT id="2751"><B>-mno-short</B><DD>


Do not consider type <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT> to be 16 bits wide.  This is the default.
<DT id="2752"><B>-mnobitfield</B><DD>



<DT id="2753"><B>-mno-bitfield</B><DD>



Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The <B>-m68000</B>, <B>-mcpu32</B>
and <B>-m5200</B> options imply <B>-mnobitfield</B>.
<DT id="2754"><B>-mbitfield</B><DD>


Do use the bit-field instructions.  The <B>-m68020</B> option implies
<B>-mbitfield</B>.  This is the default if you use a configuration
designed for a 68020.
<DT id="2755"><B>-mrtd</B><DD>


Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
that take a fixed number of arguments return with the <TT>&quot;rtd&quot;</TT>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there.


<P>


This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.


<P>


Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT>);
otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those
functions.


<P>


In addition, seriously incorrect code results if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)


<P>


The <TT>&quot;rtd&quot;</TT> instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,
68040, 68060 and <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU32</FONT> processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.


<P>


The default is <B>-mno-rtd</B>.
<DT id="2756"><B>-malign-int</B><DD>



<DT id="2757"><B>-mno-align-int</B><DD>



Control whether <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> aligns <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;long long&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;float&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> variables on a 32-bit
boundary (<B>-malign-int</B>) or a 16-bit boundary (<B>-mno-align-int</B>).
Aligning variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more memory.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you use the <B>-malign-int</B> switch, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
aligns structures containing the above types differently than
most published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.
<DT id="2758"><B>-mpcrel</B><DD>


Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly, instead of
using a global offset table.  At present, this option implies <B>-fpic</B>,
allowing at most a 16-bit offset for pc-relative addressing.  <B>-fPIC</B> is
not presently supported with <B>-mpcrel</B>, though this could be supported for
68020 and higher processors.
<DT id="2759"><B>-mno-strict-align</B><DD>



<DT id="2760"><B>-mstrict-align</B><DD>



Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references are handled by
the system.
<DT id="2761"><B>-msep-data</B><DD>


Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute-in-place in
an environment without virtual memory management.  This option implies
<B>-fPIC</B>.
<DT id="2762"><B>-mno-sep-data</B><DD>


Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.
This is the default.
<DT id="2763"><B>-mid-shared-library</B><DD>


Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library <FONT SIZE="-1">ID</FONT> method.
This allows for execute-in-place and shared libraries in an environment
without virtual memory management.  This option implies <B>-fPIC</B>.
<DT id="2764"><B>-mno-id-shared-library</B><DD>


Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are being used.
This is the default.
<DT id="2765"><B>-mshared-library-id=n</B><DD>


Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying
other values forces the allocation of that number to the current
library, but is no more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.
<DT id="2766"><B>-mxgot</B><DD>



<DT id="2767"><B>-mno-xgot</B><DD>



When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code
that works if the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> has more than 8192 entries.  This code is
larger and slower than code generated without this option.  On M680x0
processors, this option is not needed; <B>-fPIC</B> suffices.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> normally uses a single instruction to load values from the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT.</FONT>
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT>
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:


<P>




<PRE>
        relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar

</PRE>




<P>


If this happens, you should recompile your code with <B>-mxgot</B>.
It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated with
<B>-mxgot</B> is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to fetch
the value of a global symbol.


<P>


Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker,
can create multiple GOTs and sort <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries.  If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use <B>-mxgot</B> when compiling a single
object file that accesses more than 8192 <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries.  Very few do.


<P>


These options have no effect unless <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is generating
position-independent code.
<DT id="2768"><B>-mlong-jump-table-offsets</B><DD>

<B>-march=native</B> has no effect if <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not recognize
the processor.


<P>


In processor names, a final <B>000</B> can be abbreviated as <B>k</B>
(for example, <B>-march=r2k</B>).  Prefixes are optional, and
<B>vr</B> may be written <B>r</B>.


<P>


Names of the form <I>n</I><B>f2_1</B> refer to processors with
FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
<I>n</I><B>f1_1</B> refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same
rate as the core, and names of the form <I>n</I><B>f3_2</B> refer to
processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, <I>n</I><B>f</B> is accepted as a synonym
for <I>n</I><B>f2_1</B> while <I>n</I><B>x</B> and <I>b</I><B>fx</B> are
accepted as synonyms for <I>n</I><B>f1_1</B>.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is <TT>&quot;_MIPS_ARCH&quot;</TT>, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form <TT>&quot;_MIPS_ARCH_</TT>foo<TT>&quot;</TT>,
where <I>foo</I> is the capitalized value of <TT>&quot;_MIPS_ARCH&quot;</TT>.
For example, <B>-march=r2000</B> sets <TT>&quot;_MIPS_ARCH&quot;</TT>
to <TT>&quot;r2000&quot;</TT> and defines the macro <TT>&quot;_MIPS_ARCH_R2000&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Note that the <TT>&quot;_MIPS_ARCH&quot;</TT> macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it has the full prefix and does not
abbreviate <B>000</B> as <B>k</B>.  In the case of <B>from-abi</B>,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either <TT>&quot;mips1&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;mips3&quot;</TT>).  It names the default architecture when no
<B>-march</B> option is given.
<DT id="2849"><B>-mtune=</B><I>arch</I><DD>


Optimize for <I>arch</I>.  Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic
operations.  The list of <I>arch</I> values is the same as for
<B>-march</B>.


<P>


When this option is not used, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> optimizes for the processor
specified by <B>-march</B>.  By using <B>-march</B> and
<B>-mtune</B> together, it is possible to generate code that
runs on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.


<P>


<B>-mtune</B> defines the macros <TT>&quot;_MIPS_TUNE&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;_MIPS_TUNE_</TT>foo<TT>&quot;</TT>, which work in the same way as the
<B>-march</B> ones described above.

<DT id="2864"><B>-mno-mips16</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS16</FONT> code.  If <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is targeting a
<FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS32</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS64</FONT> architecture, it makes use of the MIPS16e <FONT SIZE="-1">ASE.</FONT>


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS16</FONT> code generation can also be controlled on a per-function basis
by means of <TT>&quot;mips16&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;nomips16&quot;</TT> attributes.
<DT id="2865"><B>-mflip-mips16</B><DD>


Generate <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS16</FONT> code on alternating functions.  This option is provided
for regression testing of mixed MIPS16/non-MIPS16 code generation, and is
not intended for ordinary use in compiling user code.
<DT id="2866"><B>-minterlink-compressed</B><DD>



<DT id="2867"><B>-mno-interlink-compressed</B><DD>



Require (do not require) that code using the standard (uncompressed) <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS ISA</FONT>
be link-compatible with <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS16</FONT> and microMIPS code, and vice versa.


<P>


For example, code using the standard <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> encoding cannot jump directly
to <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS16</FONT> or microMIPS code; it must either use a call or an indirect jump.
<B>-minterlink-compressed</B> therefore disables direct jumps unless <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
knows that the target of the jump is not compressed.
<DT id="2868"><B>-minterlink-mips16</B><DD>



<DT id="2869"><B>-mno-interlink-mips16</B><DD>



Aliases of <B>-minterlink-compressed</B> and

<DT id="2873"><B>-mabi=64</B><DD>


<DT id="2874"><B>-mabi=eabi</B><DD>



Generate code for the given <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>


<P>


Note that the <FONT SIZE="-1">EABI</FONT> has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> normally
generates 64-bit code when you select a 64-bit architecture, but you
can use <B>-mgp32</B> to get 32-bit code instead.


<P>


For information about the O64 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> see
&lt;<B><A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html</A></B>&gt;.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> supports a variant of the o32 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> in which floating-point registers
are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.  You can select this combination with
<B>-mabi=32</B> <B>-mfp64</B>.  This <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> relies on the <TT>&quot;mthc1&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;mfhc1&quot;</TT> instructions and is therefore only supported for
<FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS32R2, MIPS32R3</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS32R5</FONT> processors.


<P>


The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64-bit register
rather than a pair of 32-bit registers.  For example, scalar
floating-point values are returned in <B></B>$f0<B></B> only, not a
<B></B>$f0<B></B>/<B></B>$f1<B></B> pair.  The set of call-saved registers also
remains the same in that the even-numbered double-precision registers
are saved.


<P>


Two additional variants of the o32 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> are supported to enable
a transition from 32-bit to 64-bit registers.  These are <FONT SIZE="-1">FPXX</FONT>
(<B>-mfpxx</B>) and <FONT SIZE="-1">FP64A</FONT> (<B>-mfp64</B> <B>-mno-odd-spreg</B>).
The <FONT SIZE="-1">FPXX</FONT> extension mandates that all code must execute correctly
when run using 32-bit or 64-bit registers.  The code can be interlinked
with either <FONT SIZE="-1">FP32</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">FP64,</FONT> but not both.
The <FONT SIZE="-1">FP64A</FONT> extension is similar to the <FONT SIZE="-1">FP64</FONT> extension but forbids the
use of odd-numbered single-precision registers.  This can be used
in conjunction with the <TT>&quot;FRE&quot;</TT> mode of FPUs in <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS32R5</FONT>
processors and allows both <FONT SIZE="-1">FP32</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">FP64A</FONT> code to interlink and
run in the same process without changing <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> modes.
<DT id="2875"><B>-mabicalls</B><DD>



<DT id="2876"><B>-mno-abicalls</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) code that is suitable for SVR4-style
dynamic objects.  <B>-mabicalls</B> is the default for SVR4-based
systems.
<DT id="2877"><B>-mshared</B><DD>



<DT id="2878"><B>-mno-shared</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) code that is fully position-independent,
and that can therefore be linked into shared libraries.  This option
only affects <B>-mabicalls</B>.


<P>


All <B>-mabicalls</B> code has traditionally been position-independent,
regardless of options like <B>-fPIC</B> and <B>-fpic</B>.  However,
as an extension, the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> toolchain allows executables to use absolute
accesses for locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter <FONT SIZE="-1">GP</FONT>
initialization sequences and generate direct calls to locally-defined
functions.  This mode is selected by <B>-mno-shared</B>.


<P>


<B>-mno-shared</B> depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
objects that can only be linked by the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker.  However, the option
does not affect the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> of the final executable; it only affects the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>
of relocatable objects.  Using <B>-mno-shared</B> generally makes
executables both smaller and quicker.


<P>


<B>-mshared</B> is the default.
<DT id="2879"><B>-mplt</B><DD>



<DT id="2880"><B>-mno-plt</B><DD>



Assume (do not assume) that the static and dynamic linkers
support PLTs and copy relocations.  This option only affects
<B>-mno-shared -mabicalls</B>.  For the n64 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> this option
has no effect without <B>-msym32</B>.


<P>


You can make <B>-mplt</B> the default by configuring
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with <B>--with-mips-plt</B>.  The default is
<B>-mno-plt</B> otherwise.
<DT id="2881"><B>-mxgot</B><DD>



<DT id="2882"><B>-mno-xgot</B><DD>



Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global
offset table.


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> normally uses a single instruction to load values from the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT.</FONT>
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT>
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:


<P>




<PRE>
        relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar

</PRE>




<P>


If this happens, you should recompile your code with <B>-mxgot</B>.
This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also
less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.


<P>


Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use <B>-mxgot</B> when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of <FONT SIZE="-1">GOT</FONT> entries.  Very few do.


<P>


These options have no effect unless <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is generating position
independent code.
<DT id="2883"><B>-mgp32</B><DD>


Assume that general-purpose registers are 32 bits wide.
<DT id="2884"><B>-mgp64</B><DD>


Assume that general-purpose registers are 64 bits wide.
<DT id="2885"><B>-mfp32</B><DD>


Assume that floating-point registers are 32 bits wide.
<DT id="2886"><B>-mfp64</B><DD>


Assume that floating-point registers are 64 bits wide.
<DT id="2887"><B>-mfpxx</B><DD>


Do not assume the width of floating-point registers.
<DT id="2888"><B>-mhard-float</B><DD>


Use floating-point coprocessor instructions.
<DT id="2889"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>


Do not use floating-point coprocessor instructions.  Implement
floating-point calculations using library calls instead.
<DT id="2890"><B>-mno-float</B><DD>


Equivalent to <B>-msoft-float</B>, but additionally asserts that the
program being compiled does not perform any floating-point operations.
This option is presently supported only by some bare-metal <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS</FONT>
configurations, where it may select a special set of libraries
that lack all floating-point support (including, for example, the
floating-point <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT> formats).  
If code compiled with <B>-mno-float</B> accidentally contains
floating-point operations, it is likely to suffer a link-time
or run-time failure.
<DT id="2891"><B>-msingle-float</B><DD>


Assume that the floating-point coprocessor only supports single-precision
operations.
<DT id="2892"><B>-mdouble-float</B><DD>


Assume that the floating-point coprocessor supports double-precision
operations.  This is the default.
<DT id="2893"><B>-modd-spreg</B><DD>



<DT id="2894"><B>-mno-odd-spreg</B><DD>



Enable the use of odd-numbered single-precision floating-point registers
for the o32 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  This is the default for processors that are known to
support these registers.  When using the o32 <FONT SIZE="-1">FPXX ABI,</FONT> <B>-mno-odd-spreg</B>
is set by default.
<DT id="2895"><B>-mabs=2008</B><DD>



<DT id="2896"><B>-mabs=legacy</B><DD>



These options control the treatment of the special not-a-number (NaN)
<FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE 754</FONT> floating-point data with the <TT>&quot;abs.</TT>fmt<TT>&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;neg.</TT>fmt<TT>&quot;</TT> machine instructions.


<P>


By default or when <B>-mabs=legacy</B> is used the legacy
treatment is selected.  In this case these instructions are considered
arithmetic and avoided where correct operation is required and the
input operand might be a NaN.  A longer sequence of instructions that
manipulate the sign bit of floating-point datum manually is used
instead unless the <B>-ffinite-math-only</B> option has also been
specified.


<P>


The <B>-mabs=2008</B> option selects the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE 754-2008</FONT> treatment.  In
this case these instructions are considered non-arithmetic and therefore
operating correctly in all cases, including in particular where the
input operand is a NaN.  These instructions are therefore always used
for the respective operations.
<DT id="2897"><B>-mnan=2008</B><DD>



<DT id="2898"><B>-mnan=legacy</B><DD>



These options control the encoding of the special not-a-number (NaN)
<FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE 754</FONT> floating-point data.


<P>


The <B>-mnan=legacy</B> option selects the legacy encoding.  In this
case quiet NaNs (qNaNs) are denoted by the first bit of their trailing
significand field being 0, whereas signaling NaNs (sNaNs) are denoted
by the first bit of their trailing significand field being 1.


<P>


The <B>-mnan=2008</B> option selects the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE 754-2008</FONT> encoding.  In
this case qNaNs are denoted by the first bit of their trailing
significand field being 1, whereas sNaNs are denoted by the first bit of
their trailing significand field being 0.


<P>


The default is <B>-mnan=legacy</B> unless <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> has been configured with
<B>--with-nan=2008</B>.
<DT id="2899"><B>-mllsc</B><DD>



<DT id="2900"><B>-mno-llsc</B><DD>



Use (do not use) <B>ll</B>, <B>sc</B>, and <B>sync</B> instructions to
implement atomic memory built-in functions.  When neither option is
specified, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses the instructions if the target architecture
supports them.


<P>


<B>-mllsc</B> is useful if the runtime environment can emulate the
instructions and <B>-mno-llsc</B> can be useful when compiling for
nonstandard ISAs.  You can make either option the default by
configuring <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with <B>--with-llsc</B> and <B>--without-llsc</B>
respectively.  <B>--with-llsc</B> is the default for some
configurations; see the installation documentation for details.

<DT id="2936"><B>-mlong32</B><DD>


Force <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>, and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.


<P>


The default size of <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>s, <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>s and pointers depends on
the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  All the supported ABIs use 32-bit <TT>&quot;int&quot;</TT>s.  The n64 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>
uses 64-bit <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>s, as does the 64-bit <FONT SIZE="-1">EABI</FONT>; the others use
32-bit <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>s.  Pointers are the same size as <TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT>s,
or the same size as integer registers, whichever is smaller.
<DT id="2937"><B>-msym32</B><DD>



<DT id="2938"><B>-mno-sym32</B><DD>



Assume (do not assume) that all symbols have 32-bit values, regardless
of the selected <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  This option is useful in combination with
<B>-mabi=64</B> and <B>-mno-abicalls</B> because it allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
to generate shorter and faster references to symbolic addresses.
<DT id="2939"><B>-G</B> <I>num</I><DD>


Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data section
if that data is no bigger than <I>num</I> bytes.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can then generate
more efficient accesses to the data; see <B>-mgpopt</B> for details.


<P>


The default <B>-G</B> option depends on the configuration.
<DT id="2940"><B>-mlocal-sdata</B><DD>



<DT id="2941"><B>-mno-local-sdata</B><DD>



Extend (do not extend) the <B>-G</B> behavior to local data too,
such as to static variables in C.  <B>-mlocal-sdata</B> is the
default for all configurations.


<P>


If the linker complains that an application is using too much small data,
you might want to try rebuilding the less performance-critical parts with
<B>-mno-local-sdata</B>.  You might also want to build large
libraries with <B>-mno-local-sdata</B>, so that the libraries leave
more room for the main program.
<DT id="2942"><B>-mextern-sdata</B><DD>



<DT id="2943"><B>-mno-extern-sdata</B><DD>



Assume (do not assume) that externally-defined data is in
a small data section if the size of that data is within the <B>-G</B> limit.
<B>-mextern-sdata</B> is the default for all configurations.


<P>


If you compile a module <I>Mod</I> with <B>-mextern-sdata</B> <B>-G</B>
<I>num</I> <B>-mgpopt</B>, and <I>Mod</I> references a variable <I>Var</I>
that is no bigger than <I>num</I> bytes, you must make sure that <I>Var</I>
is placed in a small data section.  If <I>Var</I> is defined by another
module, you must either compile that module with a high-enough
<B>-G</B> setting or attach a <TT>&quot;section&quot;</TT> attribute to <I>Var</I>'s
definition.  If <I>Var</I> is common, you must link the application
with a high-enough <B>-G</B> setting.


<P>


The easiest way of satisfying these restrictions is to compile
and link every module with the same <B>-G</B> option.  However,
you may wish to build a library that supports several different
small data limits.  You can do this by compiling the library with
the highest supported <B>-G</B> setting and additionally using
<B>-mno-extern-sdata</B> to stop the library from making assumptions
about externally-defined data.
<DT id="2944"><B>-mgpopt</B><DD>



<DT id="2945"><B>-mno-gpopt</B><DD>



Use (do not use) GP-relative accesses for symbols that are known to be
in a small data section; see <B>-G</B>, <B>-mlocal-sdata</B> and
<B>-mextern-sdata</B>.  <B>-mgpopt</B> is the default for all
configurations.


<P>


<B>-mno-gpopt</B> is useful for cases where the <TT>$gp</TT> register
might not hold the value of <TT>&quot;_gp&quot;</TT>.  For example, if the code is
part of a library that might be used in a boot monitor, programs that
call boot monitor routines pass an unknown value in <TT>$gp</TT>.
(In such situations, the boot monitor itself is usually compiled
with <B>-G0</B>.)


<P>


<B>-mno-gpopt</B> implies <B>-mno-local-sdata</B> and
<B>-mno-extern-sdata</B>.
<DT id="2946"><B>-membedded-data</B><DD>



<DT id="2947"><B>-mno-embedded-data</B><DD>



Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if possible, then
next in the small data section if possible, otherwise in data.  This gives
slightly slower code than the default, but reduces the amount of <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT> required
when executing, and thus may be preferred for some embedded systems.
<DT id="2948"><B>-muninit-const-in-rodata</B><DD>



<DT id="2949"><B>-mno-uninit-const-in-rodata</B><DD>



Put uninitialized <TT>&quot;const&quot;</TT> variables in the read-only data section.
This option is only meaningful in conjunction with <B>-membedded-data</B>.
<DT id="2950"><B>-mcode-readable=</B><I>setting</I><DD>


Specify whether <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may generate code that reads from executable sections.
There are three possible settings:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="2951"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="2952"><B>-mcode-readable=yes</B><DD>


Instructions may freely access executable sections.  This is the
default setting.
<DT id="2953"><B>-mcode-readable=pcrel</B><DD>


<FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS16</FONT> PC-relative load instructions can access executable sections,
but other instructions must not do so.  This option is useful on 4KSc
and 4KSd processors when the code TLBs have the Read Inhibit bit set.
It is also useful on processors that can be configured to have a dual
instruction/data <FONT SIZE="-1">SRAM</FONT> interface and that, like the M4K, automatically
redirect PC-relative loads to the instruction <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM.</FONT>
<DT id="2954"><B>-mcode-readable=no</B><DD>


Instructions must not access executable sections.  This option can be
useful on targets that are configured to have a dual instruction/data
<FONT SIZE="-1">SRAM</FONT> interface but that (unlike the M4K) do not automatically redirect
PC-relative loads to the instruction <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM.</FONT>

<DT id="2956"><B>-msplit-addresses</B><DD>



<DT id="2957"><B>-mno-split-addresses</B><DD>



Enable (disable) use of the <TT>&quot;%hi()&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;%lo()&quot;</TT> assembler
relocation operators.  This option has been superseded by
<B>-mexplicit-relocs</B> but is retained for backwards compatibility.
<DT id="2958"><B>-mexplicit-relocs</B><DD>



<DT id="2959"><B>-mno-explicit-relocs</B><DD>



Use (do not use) assembler relocation operators when dealing with symbolic
addresses.  The alternative, selected by <B>-mno-explicit-relocs</B>,
is to use assembler macros instead.


<P>


<B>-mexplicit-relocs</B> is the default if <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was configured

<DT id="2960"><B>-mcheck-zero-division</B><DD>



<DT id="2961"><B>-mno-check-zero-division</B><DD>



Trap (do not trap) on integer division by zero.


<P>


The default is <B>-mcheck-zero-division</B>.
<DT id="2962"><B>-mdivide-traps</B><DD>



<DT id="2963"><B>-mdivide-breaks</B><DD>



<FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS</FONT> systems check for division by zero by generating either a
conditional trap or a break instruction.  Using traps results in
smaller code, but is only supported on <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS II</FONT> and later.  Also, some
versions of the Linux kernel have a bug that prevents trap from
generating the proper signal (<TT>&quot;SIGFPE&quot;</TT>).  Use <B>-mdivide-traps</B> to
allow conditional traps on architectures that support them and
<B>-mdivide-breaks</B> to force the use of breaks.


<P>


The default is usually <B>-mdivide-traps</B>, but this can be
overridden at configure time using <B>--with-divide=breaks</B>.
Divide-by-zero checks can be completely disabled using
<B>-mno-check-zero-division</B>.
<DT id="2964"><B>-mload-store-pairs</B><DD>



<DT id="2965"><B>-mno-load-store-pairs</B><DD>

default but only takes effect when the selected architecture is known
to support bonding.
<DT id="2966"><B>-mmemcpy</B><DD>



<DT id="2967"><B>-mno-memcpy</B><DD>



Force (do not force) the use of <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> for non-trivial block
moves.  The default is <B>-mno-memcpy</B>, which allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to inline
most constant-sized copies.
<DT id="2968"><B>-mlong-calls</B><DD>



<DT id="2969"><B>-mno-long-calls</B><DD>



Disable (do not disable) use of the <TT>&quot;jal&quot;</TT> instruction.  Calling
functions using <TT>&quot;jal&quot;</TT> is more efficient but requires the caller
and callee to be in the same 256 megabyte segment.

This option has no effect on abicalls code.  The default is
<B>-mno-long-calls</B>.
<DT id="2970"><B>-mmad</B><DD>

<DT id="2972"><B>-mimadd</B><DD>



<DT id="2973"><B>-mno-imadd</B><DD>



Enable (disable) use of the <TT>&quot;madd&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;msub&quot;</TT> integer

that support <TT>&quot;madd&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;msub&quot;</TT> except for the 74k 
architecture where it was found to generate slower code.
<DT id="2974"><B>-mfused-madd</B><DD>



<DT id="2975"><B>-mno-fused-madd</B><DD>



Enable (disable) use of the floating-point multiply-accumulate
instructions, when they are available.  The default is
<B>-mfused-madd</B>.


<P>


On the R8000 <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> when multiply-accumulate instructions are used,
the intermediate product is calculated to infinite precision
and is not subject to the <FONT SIZE="-1">FCSR</FONT> Flush to Zero bit.  This may be
undesirable in some circumstances.  On other processors the result
is numerically identical to the equivalent computation using
separate multiply, add, subtract and negate instructions.

<DT id="3009"><B>-mr10k-cache-barrier=</B><I>setting</I><DD>


Specify whether <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> should insert cache barriers to avoid the
side effects of speculation on R10K processors.


<P>


In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome
of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions from
the ``taken'' branch.  It later aborts these instructions if the
predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the R10K, even aborted
instructions can have side effects.


<P>


This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system,
kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed store may load
the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if
the store itself is later aborted.  If a <FONT SIZE="-1">DMA</FONT> operation writes to the
same area of memory before the ``dirty'' line is flushed, the cached
data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
for a full description, including other potential problems.


<P>


One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every memory
access that might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted.  <B>-mr10k-cache-barrier=</B><I>setting</I>
controls <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>'s implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
side effects:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3010"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3011">1.<DD>


the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;
<DT id="3012">2.<DD>


the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;
<DT id="3013">3.<DD>


the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="3014"><DD>


<P>


It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
accesses to these regions are indeed safe.


<P>


If the input program contains a function declaration such as:


<P>




<PRE>
        void foo (void);

</PRE>




<P>


then the implementation of <TT>&quot;foo&quot;</TT> must allow <TT>&quot;j foo&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;jal foo&quot;</TT> to be executed speculatively.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC
functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do the same.


<P>


The option has three forms:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3015"><B>-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store</B><DD>


Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
if aborted.
<DT id="3016"><B>-mr10k-cache-barrier=store</B><DD>


Insert a cache barrier before a store that might be speculatively
executed and that might have side effects even if aborted.
<DT id="3017"><B>-mr10k-cache-barrier=none</B><DD>

<DT id="3019"><B>-mflush-func=</B><I>func</I><DD>



<DT id="3020"><B>-mno-flush-func</B><DD>



Specifies the function to call to flush the I and D caches, or to not
call any such function.  If called, the function must take the same
arguments as the common <TT>&quot;_flush_func&quot;</TT>, that is, the address of the
memory range for which the cache is being flushed, the size of the
memory range, and the number 3 (to flush both caches).  The default
depends on the target <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was configured for, but commonly is either
<TT>&quot;_flush_func&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;__cpu_flush&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="3021"><B>mbranch-cost=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Set the cost of branches to roughly <I>num</I> ``simple'' instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.  A zero cost redundantly selects
the default, which is based on the <B>-mtune</B> setting.
<DT id="3022"><B>-mbranch-likely</B><DD>



<DT id="3023"><B>-mno-branch-likely</B><DD>



Enable or disable use of Branch Likely instructions, regardless of the
default for the selected architecture.  By default, Branch Likely
instructions may be generated if they are supported by the selected
architecture.  An exception is for the <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS32</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS64</FONT> architectures
and processors that implement those architectures; for those, Branch
Likely instructions are not be generated by default because the <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS32</FONT>
and <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS64</FONT> architectures specifically deprecate their use.
<DT id="3024"><B>-mcompact-branches=never</B><DD>



<DT id="3025"><B>-mcompact-branches=optimal</B><DD>


<DT id="3026"><B>-mcompact-branches=always</B><DD>



These options control which form of branches will be generated.  The
default is <B>-mcompact-branches=optimal</B>.


<P>


The <B>-mcompact-branches=never</B> option ensures that compact branch
instructions will never be generated.


<P>


The <B>-mcompact-branches=always</B> option ensures that a compact
branch instruction will be generated if available.  If a compact branch
instruction is not available, a delay slot form of the branch will be
used instead.


<P>


This option is supported from <FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS</FONT> Release 6 onwards.


<P>


The <B>-mcompact-branches=optimal</B> option will cause a delay slot
branch to be used if one is available in the current <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> and the delay
slot is successfully filled.  If the delay slot is not filled, a compact
branch will be chosen if one is available.
<DT id="3027"><B>-mfp-exceptions</B><DD>



<DT id="3028"><B>-mno-fp-exceptions</B><DD>



Specifies whether <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> exceptions are enabled.  This affects how
<FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> instructions are scheduled for some processors.
The default is that <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> exceptions are
enabled.


<P>


For instance, on the <FONT SIZE="-1">SB-1,</FONT> if <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> exceptions are disabled, and we are emitting
64-bit code, then we can use both <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> pipes.  Otherwise, we can only use one
<FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> pipe.
<DT id="3029"><B>-mvr4130-align</B><DD>



<DT id="3030"><B>-mno-vr4130-align</B><DD>



The <FONT SIZE="-1">VR4130</FONT> pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only issue two
instructions together if the first one is 8-byte aligned.  When this
option is enabled, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> aligns pairs of instructions that it
thinks should execute in parallel.


<P>


This option only has an effect when optimizing for the <FONT SIZE="-1">VR4130.</FONT>
It normally makes code faster, but at the expense of making it bigger.
It is enabled by default at optimization level <B>-O3</B>.
<DT id="3031"><B>-msynci</B><DD>



<DT id="3032"><B>-mno-synci</B><DD>



Enable (disable) generation of <TT>&quot;synci&quot;</TT> instructions on
architectures that support it.  The <TT>&quot;synci&quot;</TT> instructions (if
enabled) are generated when <TT>&quot;__builtin___clear_cache&quot;</TT> is
compiled.


<P>


This option defaults to <B>-mno-synci</B>, but the default can be
overridden by configuring <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with <B>--with-synci</B>.


<P>


When compiling code for single processor systems, it is generally safe
to use <TT>&quot;synci&quot;</TT>.  However, on many multi-core (<FONT SIZE="-1">SMP</FONT>) systems, it
does not invalidate the instruction caches on all cores and may lead
to undefined behavior.
<DT id="3033"><B>-mrelax-pic-calls</B><DD>



<DT id="3034"><B>-mno-relax-pic-calls</B><DD>



Try to turn <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> calls that are normally dispatched via register
<TT>$25</TT> into direct calls.  This is only possible if the linker can
resolve the destination at link time and if the destination is within
range for a direct call.


<P>


<B>-mrelax-pic-calls</B> is the default if <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> was configured to use
an assembler and a linker that support the <TT>&quot;.reloc&quot;</TT> assembly
directive and <B>-mexplicit-relocs</B> is in effect.  With
<B>-mno-explicit-relocs</B>, this optimization can be performed by the
assembler and the linker alone without help from the compiler.
<DT id="3035"><B>-mmcount-ra-address</B><DD>



<DT id="3036"><B>-mno-mcount-ra-address</B><DD>



Emit (do not emit) code that allows <TT>&quot;_mcount&quot;</TT> to modify the

the usual <TT>&quot;_mcount&quot;</TT> interface with a new <I>ra-address</I>
parameter, which has type <TT>&quot;intptr_t *&quot;</TT> and is passed in register
<TT>$12</TT>.  <TT>&quot;_mcount&quot;</TT> can then modify the return address by

<DT id="3041"><B>-mframe-header-opt</B><DD>



<DT id="3042"><B>-mno-frame-header-opt</B><DD>



Enable (disable) frame header optimization in the o32 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  When using the
o32 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> calling functions will allocate 16 bytes on the stack for the called
function to write out register arguments.  When enabled, this optimization
will suppress the allocation of the frame header if it can be determined that
it is unused.

<DT id="3062"><B>-mbase-addresses</B><DD>



<DT id="3063"><B>-mno-base-addresses</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) code that uses <I>base addresses</I>.  Using a
base address automatically generates a request (handled by the assembler
and the linker) for a constant to be set up in a global register.  The
register is used for one or more base address requests within the range 0
to 255 from the value held in the register.  The generally leads to short
and fast code, but the number of different data items that can be
addressed is limited.  This means that a program that uses lots of static
data may require <B>-mno-base-addresses</B>.
<DT id="3064"><B>-msingle-exit</B><DD>

<DT id="3073"><B>-mreturn-pointer-on-d0</B><DD>


When generating a function that returns a pointer, return the pointer
in both <TT>&quot;a0&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;d0&quot;</TT>.  Otherwise, the pointer is returned
only in <TT>&quot;a0&quot;</TT>, and attempts to call such functions without a prototype
result in errors.  Note that this option is on by default; use
<B>-mno-return-pointer-on-d0</B> to disable it.
<DT id="3074"><B>-mno-crt0</B><DD>


Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.
<DT id="3075"><B>-mrelax</B><DD>


Indicate to the linker that it should perform a relaxation optimization pass
to shorten branches, calls and absolute memory addresses.  This option only
has an effect when used on the command line for the final link step.


<P>


This option makes symbolic debugging impossible.
<DT id="3076"><B>-mliw</B><DD>


Allow the compiler to generate <I>Long Instruction Word</I>

<I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>MSP430</I></FONT><I> Options</I>


<P>

These options are defined for the <FONT SIZE="-1">MSP430:</FONT>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3084"><B>-masm-hex</B><DD>


Force assembly output to always use hex constants.  Normally such
constants are signed decimals, but this option is available for
testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.
<DT id="3085"><B>-mmcu=</B><DD>


Select the <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> to target.  This is used to create a C preprocessor
symbol based upon the <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> name, converted to upper case and pre- and
post-fixed with <B>__</B>.  This in turn is used by the
<I>msp430.h</I> header file to select an MCU-specific supplementary
header file.


<P>


The option also sets the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> to use.  If the <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> name is one that is
known to only support the 430 <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> then that is selected, otherwise the
430X <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> is selected.  A generic <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> name of <B>msp430</B> can also be
used to select the 430 <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA.</FONT>  Similarly the generic <B>msp430x</B> <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT>
name selects the 430X <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA.</FONT>


<P>


In addition an MCU-specific linker script is added to the linker
command line.  The script's name is the name of the <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> with
<I>.ld</I> appended.  Thus specifying <B>-mmcu=xxx</B> on the <B>gcc</B>
command line defines the C preprocessor symbol <TT>&quot;__XXX__&quot;</TT> and
cause the linker to search for a script called <I>xxx.ld</I>.


<P>


This option is also passed on to the assembler.
<DT id="3086"><B>-mwarn-mcu</B><DD>



<DT id="3087"><B>-mno-warn-mcu</B><DD>



This option enables or disables warnings about conflicts between the
<FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> name specified by the <B>-mmcu</B> option and the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> set by the
<B>-mcpu</B> option and/or the hardware multiply support set by the
<B>-mhwmult</B> option.  It also toggles warnings about unrecognized
<FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> names.  This option is on by default.
<DT id="3088"><B>-mcpu=</B><DD>


Specifies the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> to use.  Accepted values are <B>msp430</B>,
<B>msp430x</B> and <B>msp430xv2</B>.  This option is deprecated.  The
<B>-mmcu=</B> option should be used to select the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA.</FONT>
<DT id="3089"><B>-msim</B><DD>


Link to the simulator runtime libraries and linker script.  Overrides
any scripts that would be selected by the <B>-mmcu=</B> option.
<DT id="3090"><B>-mlarge</B><DD>


Use large-model addressing (20-bit pointers, 32-bit <TT>&quot;size_t&quot;</TT>).
<DT id="3091"><B>-msmall</B><DD>


Use small-model addressing (16-bit pointers, 16-bit <TT>&quot;size_t&quot;</TT>).
<DT id="3092"><B>-mrelax</B><DD>


This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and allows the
linker to perform certain optimizations that cannot be done until
the final link.
<DT id="3093"><B>mhwmult=</B><DD>


Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the target.
Accepted values are <B>none</B> for no hardware multiply, <B>16bit</B>
for the original 16-bit-only multiply supported by early MCUs.
<B>32bit</B> for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by later MCUs and
<B>f5series</B> for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by F5-series MCUs.
A value of <B>auto</B> can also be given.  This tells <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to deduce
the hardware multiply support based upon the <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> name provided by the
<B>-mmcu</B> option.  If no <B>-mmcu</B> option is specified or if
the <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT> name is not recognized then no hardware multiply support is
assumed.  <TT>&quot;auto&quot;</TT> is the default setting.


<P>


Hardware multiplies are normally performed by calling a library
routine.  This saves space in the generated code.  When compiling at
<B>-O3</B> or higher however the hardware multiplier is invoked
inline.  This makes for bigger, but faster code.


<P>


The hardware multiply routines disable interrupts whilst running and
restore the previous interrupt state when they finish.  This makes
them safe to use inside interrupt handlers as well as in normal code.
<DT id="3094"><B>-minrt</B><DD>


Enable the use of a minimum runtime environment - no static
initializers or constructors.  This is intended for memory-constrained
devices.  The compiler includes special symbols in some objects
that tell the linker and runtime which code fragments are required.
<DT id="3095"><B>-mcode-region=</B><DD>



<DT id="3096"><B>-mdata-region=</B><DD>



These options tell the compiler where to place functions and data that
do not have one of the <TT>&quot;lower&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;upper&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;either&quot;</TT> or
<TT>&quot;section&quot;</TT> attributes.  Possible values are <TT>&quot;lower&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;upper&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;either&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;any&quot;</TT>.  The first three behave
like the corresponding attribute.  The fourth possible value -
<TT>&quot;any&quot;</TT> - is the default.  It leaves placement entirely up to the
linker script and how it assigns the standard sections
(<TT>&quot;.text&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;.data&quot;</TT>, etc) to the memory regions.
<DT id="3097"><B>-msilicon-errata=</B><DD>


This option passes on a request to assembler to enable the fixes for
the named silicon errata.
<DT id="3098"><B>-msilicon-errata-warn=</B><DD>


This option passes on a request to the assembler to enable warning
messages when a silicon errata might need to be applied.

<I>option</I> names are recognized:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3130"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3131"><B>none</B><DD>


Do not generate GP-relative accesses.
<DT id="3132"><B>local</B><DD>


Generate GP-relative accesses for small data objects that are not 
external, weak, or uninitialized common symbols.  
Also use GP-relative addressing for objects that
have been explicitly placed in a small data section via a <TT>&quot;section&quot;</TT>
attribute.
<DT id="3133"><B>global</B><DD>


As for <B>local</B>, but also generate GP-relative accesses for
small data objects that are external, weak, or common.  If you use this option,
you must ensure that all parts of your program (including libraries) are
compiled with the same <B>-G</B> setting.
<DT id="3134"><B>data</B><DD>


Generate GP-relative accesses for all data objects in the program.  If you
use this option, the entire data and <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> segments
of your program must fit in 64K of memory and you must use an appropriate
linker script to allocate them within the addressable range of the

<P>


<B>-mgpopt</B> is equivalent to <B>-mgpopt=local</B>, and

<P>


The default is <B>-mgpopt</B> except when <B>-fpic</B> or
<B>-fPIC</B> is specified to generate position-independent code.
Note that the Nios <FONT SIZE="-1">II ABI</FONT> does not permit GP-relative accesses from
shared libraries.


<P>


You may need to specify <B>-mno-gpopt</B> explicitly when building
programs that include large amounts of small data, including large

The <I>regexp</I> is a <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> Extended Regular Expression.


<P>


This option does not affect the behavior of the <B>-G</B> option, and

of the 32-bit address space.  It is most useful in conjunction with 
<TT>&quot;section&quot;</TT> attributes on variable declarations and a custom linker script.  
The <I>regexp</I> is a <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> Extended Regular Expression.


<P>


In contrast to the use of GP-relative addressing for small data, 
zero-based addressing is never generated by default and there are no 
conventional section names used in standard linker scripts for sections

<P>


In addition, all of the following transfer instructions for internal
registers X and Y must be provided to use any of the double-precision
floating-point instructions.  Custom instructions taking two
double-precision source operands expect the first operand in the
64-bit register X.  The other operand (or only operand of a unary
operation) is given to the custom arithmetic instruction with the
least significant half in source register <I>src1</I> and the most
significant half in <I>src2</I>.  A custom instruction that returns a
double-precision result returns the most significant 32 bits in the
destination register and the other half in 32-bit register Y.  
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> automatically generates the necessary code sequences to write
register X and/or read register Y when double-precision floating-point
instructions are used.

<DT id="3198"><B>-msoft-stack</B><DD>


Generate code that does not use <TT>&quot;.local&quot;</TT> memory
directly for stack storage. Instead, a per-warp stack pointer is
maintained explicitly. This enables variable-length stack allocation (with
variable-length arrays or <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT>), and when global memory is used for
underlying storage, makes it possible to access automatic variables from other
threads, or with atomic instructions. This code generation variant is used
for OpenMP offloading, but the option is exposed on its own for the purpose
of testing the compiler; to generate code suitable for linking into programs
using OpenMP offloading, use option <B>-mgomp</B>.
<DT id="3199"><B>-muniform-simt</B><DD>


Switch to code generation variant that allows to execute all threads in each
warp, while maintaining memory state and side effects as if only one thread
in each warp was active outside of OpenMP <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> regions.  All atomic operations
and calls to runtime (malloc, free, vprintf) are conditionally executed (iff
current lane index equals the master lane index), and the register being
assigned is copied via a shuffle instruction from the master lane.  Outside of
<FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> regions lane 0 is the master; inside, each thread sees itself as the
master.  Shared memory array <TT>&quot;int __nvptx_uni[]&quot;</TT> stores all-zeros or
all-ones bitmasks for each warp, indicating current mode (0 outside of <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT>

<DT id="3228"><B>-mae=</B><I>ae_type</I><DD>


Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
parameters for array element type <I>ae_type</I>.  Supported values
for <I>ae_type</I> are <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>ANY</B></FONT><B></B>, <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MUL</B></FONT><B></B>, and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MAC</B></FONT><B></B>.


<P>


<B>-mae=ANY</B> selects a completely generic <FONT SIZE="-1">AE</FONT> type.  Code
generated with this option runs on any of the other <FONT SIZE="-1">AE</FONT> types.  The
code is not as efficient as it would be if compiled for a specific
<FONT SIZE="-1">AE</FONT> type, and some types of operation (e.g., multiplication) do not
work properly on all types of <FONT SIZE="-1">AE.</FONT>


<P>


<B>-mae=MUL</B> selects a <FONT SIZE="-1">MUL AE</FONT> type.  This is the most useful <FONT SIZE="-1">AE</FONT> type
for compiled code, and is the default.


<P>


<B>-mae=MAC</B> selects a DSP-style <FONT SIZE="-1">MAC AE.</FONT>  Code compiled with this
option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char) manipulation,
since the <FONT SIZE="-1">DSP AE</FONT> does not provide hardware support for byte load/stores.
<DT id="3229"><B>-msymbol-as-address</B><DD>


Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an address in a
load/store instruction, without first loading it into a
register.  Typically, the use of this option generates larger
programs, which run faster than when the option isn't used.  However, the
results vary from program to program, so it is left as a user option,
rather than being permanently enabled.
<DT id="3230"><B>-mno-inefficient-warnings</B><DD>


Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.  These
warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code that
performs byte-level memory operations on the <FONT SIZE="-1">MAC AE</FONT> type.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">MAC AE</FONT> has
no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all byte
load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is
inefficient and a warning is generated to indicate
that you should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to target
an <FONT SIZE="-1">AE</FONT> type that has the necessary hardware support.  This option disables
these warnings.

non-PIC.  The default is <B>-mplt</B>.
<DT id="3234"><B>-mabi=</B><I>ABI-string</I><DD>


Specify integer and floating-point calling convention.  <I>ABI-string</I>
contains two parts: the size of integer types and the registers used for
floating-point types.  For example <B>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64d</B> means that
<B>long</B> and pointers are 64-bit (implicitly defining <B>int</B> to be
32-bit), and that floating-point values up to 64 bits wide are passed in F
registers.  Contrast this with <B>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64f</B>, which still
allows the compiler to generate code that uses the F and D extensions but only
allows floating-point values up to 32 bits long to be passed in registers; or
<B>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64</B>, in which no floating-point arguments will be
passed in registers.


<P>


The default for this argument is system dependent, users who want a specific
calling convention should specify one explicitly.  The valid calling
conventions are: <B>ilp32</B>, <B>ilp32f</B>, <B>ilp32d</B>, <B>lp64</B>,
<B>lp64f</B>, and <B>lp64d</B>.  Some calling conventions are impossible to
implement on some ISAs: for example, <B>-march=rv32if -mabi=ilp32d</B> is
invalid because the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> requires 64-bit values be passed in F registers, but F
registers are only 32 bits wide.  There is also the <B>ilp32e</B> <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> that can
only be used with the <B>rv32e</B> architecture.  This <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> is not well
specified at present, and is subject to change.
<DT id="3235"><B>-mfdiv</B><DD>



<DT id="3236"><B>-mno-fdiv</B><DD>



Do or don't use hardware floating-point divide and square root instructions.

is to use them if the specified architecture has these instructions.
<DT id="3237"><B>-mdiv</B><DD>



<DT id="3238"><B>-mno-div</B><DD>



Do or don't use hardware instructions for integer division.  This requires the

these instructions.
<DT id="3239"><B>-march=</B><I>ISA-string</I><DD>


Generate code for given RISC-V <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> (e.g. <B>rv64im</B>).  <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> strings must be
lower-case.  Examples include <B>rv64i</B>, <B>rv32g</B>, <B>rv32e</B>, and
<B>rv32imaf</B>.
<DT id="3240"><B>-mtune=</B><I>processor-string</I><DD>

<P>


When <B>-mtune=</B> is not specified, the default is <B>rocket</B>.


<P>


The <B>size</B> choice is not intended for use by end-users.  This is used
when <B>-Os</B> is specified.  It overrides the instruction cost info
provided by <B>-mtune=</B>, but does not override the pipeline info.  This
helps reduce code size while still giving good performance.
<DT id="3241"><B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <I>num</I>
byte boundary.  If <B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</B> is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128-bits).


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> If you use this switch, then you must build all modules with
the same value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries

epilogues.
<DT id="3245"><B>-mstrict-align</B><DD>



<DT id="3246"><B>-mno-strict-align</B><DD>



Do not or do generate unaligned memory accesses.  The default is set depending
on whether the processor we are optimizing for supports fast unaligned access
or not.
<DT id="3247"><B>-mcmodel=medlow</B><DD>


Generate code for the medium-low code model. The program and its statically
defined symbols must lie within a single 2 GiB address range and must lie
between absolute addresses -2 GiB and +2 GiB. Programs can be
statically or dynamically linked. This is the default code model.
<DT id="3248"><B>-mcmodel=medany</B><DD>


Generate code for the medium-any code model. The program and its statically

Specifies the type of hardware multiplication and division support to
be used.  The simplest is <TT>&quot;none&quot;</TT>, which uses software for both
multiplication and division.  This is the default.  The <TT>&quot;g13&quot;</TT>
value is for the hardware multiply/divide peripheral found on the
<FONT SIZE="-1">RL78/G13</FONT> (S2 core) targets.  The <TT>&quot;g14&quot;</TT> value selects the use of
the multiplication and division instructions supported by the <FONT SIZE="-1">RL78/G14</FONT>
(S3 core) parts.  The value <TT>&quot;rl78&quot;</TT> is an alias for <TT>&quot;g14&quot;</TT> and

<P>


In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based upon the setting

<DT id="3263"><B>-mcpu=g14</B><DD>


<DT id="3264"><B>-mcpu=rl78</B><DD>



Specifies the <FONT SIZE="-1">RL78</FONT> core to target.  The default is the G14 core, also
known as an S3 core or just <FONT SIZE="-1">RL78.</FONT>  The G13 or S2 core does not have
multiply or divide instructions, instead it uses a hardware peripheral
for these operations.  The G10 or S1 core does not have register
banks, so it uses a different calling convention.


<P>


If this option is set it also selects the type of hardware multiply
support to use, unless this is overridden by an explicit
<B>-mmul=none</B> option on the command line.  Thus specifying
<B>-mcpu=g13</B> enables the use of the G13 hardware multiply
peripheral and specifying <B>-mcpu=g10</B> disables the use of
hardware multiplications altogether.


<P>


Note, although the <FONT SIZE="-1">RL78/G14</FONT> core is the default target, specifying
<B>-mcpu=g14</B> or <B>-mcpu=rl78</B> on the command line does
change the behavior of the toolchain since it also enables G14
hardware multiply support.  If these options are not specified on the
command line then software multiplication routines will be used even
though the code targets the <FONT SIZE="-1">RL78</FONT> core.  This is for backwards
compatibility with older toolchains which did not have hardware
multiply and divide support.


<P>


In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based upon the setting
of this option.  Possible values are: <TT>&quot;__RL78_G10__&quot;</TT>,

Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
<FONT SIZE="-1">MDUC</FONT> registers.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the <FONT SIZE="-1">MDUC</FONT> registers, for example because it performs multiplication
and division operations.  The default is to ignore the <FONT SIZE="-1">MDUC</FONT> registers
as this makes the interrupt handlers faster.  The target option -mg13
needs to be passed for this to work as this feature is only available
on the G13 target (S2 core).  The <FONT SIZE="-1">MDUC</FONT> registers will only be saved
if the interrupt handler performs a multiplication or division
operation or it calls another function.

You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  Specifying the
<B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I> overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the <B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I> option
rather than the options listed above.


<P>


Specifying <B>-mpowerpc-gpopt</B> allows
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
<B>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</B> allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.


<P>


The <B>-mmfcrf</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the move from
condition register field instruction implemented on the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER4</FONT>
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01
architecture.
The <B>-mpopcntb</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the popcount and

The <B>-mpopcntd</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the popcount
instruction implemented on the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER7</FONT> processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC V2.06 architecture.
The <B>-mfprnd</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> round to
integer instructions implemented on the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER5+</FONT> processor and other
processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.
The <B>-mcmpb</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the compare bytes
instruction implemented on the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER6</FONT> processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC V2.05 architecture.
The <B>-mmfpgpr</B> option allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to generate the <FONT SIZE="-1">FP</FONT> move to/from
general-purpose register instructions implemented on the <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER6X</FONT>
processor and other processors that support the extended PowerPC V2.05

<P>


<B>-mcpu=powerpc</B>, <B>-mcpu=powerpc64</B>, and
<B>-mcpu=powerpc64le</B> specify pure 32-bit PowerPC (either
endian), 64-bit big endian PowerPC and 64-bit little endian PowerPC
architecture machine types, with an appropriate, generic processor
model assumed for scheduling purposes.


<P>


Specifying <B>native</B> as cpu type detects and selects the
architecture option that corresponds to the host processor of the
system performing the compilation.
<B>-mcpu=native</B> has no effect if <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not recognize the
processor.


<P>


The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated under
those options runs best on that processor, and may not run at all on
others.


<P>


The <B>-mcpu</B> options automatically enable or disable the
following options:

<P>


The particular options set for any particular <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> varies between
compiler versions, depending on what setting seems to produce optimal
code for that <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>; it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual hardware's
capabilities.  If you wish to set an individual option to a particular
value, you may specify it after the <B>-mcpu</B> option, like
<B>-mcpu=970 -mno-altivec</B>.


<P>


On <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX,</FONT> the <B>-maltivec</B> and <B>-mpowerpc64</B> options are
not enabled or disabled by the <B>-mcpu</B> option at present because
<FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> does not have full support for these options.  You may still
enable or disable them individually if you're sure it'll work in your
environment.
<DT id="3295"><B>-mtune=</B><I>cpu_type</I><DD>


Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
<I>cpu_type</I>, but do not set the architecture type or register usage,
as <B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I> does.  The same
values for <I>cpu_type</I> are used for <B>-mtune</B> as for
<B>-mcpu</B>.  If both are specified, the code generated uses the
architecture and registers set by <B>-mcpu</B>, but the
scheduling parameters set by <B>-mtune</B>.
<DT id="3296"><B>-mcmodel=small</B><DD>


Generate PowerPC64 code for the small model: The <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> is limited to

Linux.
<DT id="3298"><B>-mcmodel=large</B><DD>


Generate PowerPC64 code for the large model: The <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> may be up to 4G

space.
<DT id="3299"><B>-maltivec</B><DD>



<DT id="3300"><B>-mno-altivec</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) AltiVec instructions, and also
enable the use of built-in functions that allow more direct access to
the AltiVec instruction set.  You may also need to set
<B>-mabi=altivec</B> to adjust the current <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> with AltiVec <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>
enhancements.


<P>


When <B>-maltivec</B> is used, the element order for AltiVec intrinsics
such as <TT>&quot;vec_splat&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;vec_extract&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;vec_insert&quot;</TT> 
match array element order corresponding to the endianness of the
target.  That is, element zero identifies the leftmost element in a
vector register when targeting a big-endian platform, and identifies
the rightmost element in a vector register when targeting a
little-endian platform.
<DT id="3301"><B>-mvrsave</B><DD>



<DT id="3302"><B>-mno-vrsave</B><DD>



Generate <FONT SIZE="-1">VRSAVE</FONT> instructions when generating AltiVec code.
<DT id="3303"><B>-msecure-plt</B><DD>


Generate code that allows <B>ld</B> and <B>ld.so</B>

<DT id="3304"><B>-mbss-plt</B><DD>


Generate code that uses a <FONT SIZE="-1">BSS</FONT> <TT>&quot;.plt&quot;</TT> section that <B>ld.so</B>
fills in, and
requires <TT>&quot;.plt&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;.got&quot;</TT>

<DT id="3307"><B>-mvsx</B><DD>



<DT id="3308"><B>-mno-vsx</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) vector/scalar (<FONT SIZE="-1">VSX</FONT>)

more direct access to the <FONT SIZE="-1">VSX</FONT> instruction set.
<DT id="3309"><B>-mcrypto</B><DD>



<DT id="3310"><B>-mno-crypto</B><DD>

the vector instructions.
<DT id="3317"><B>-mquad-memory</B><DD>



<DT id="3318"><B>-mno-quad-memory</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the non-atomic quad word memory

64-bit mode.
<DT id="3319"><B>-mquad-memory-atomic</B><DD>



<DT id="3320"><B>-mno-quad-memory-atomic</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the atomic quad word memory

<DT id="3321"><B>-mfloat128</B><DD>



<DT id="3322"><B>-mno-float128</B><DD>



Enable/disable the <I>__float128</I> keyword for <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> 128-bit floating point
and use either software emulation for <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> 128-bit floating point or
hardware instructions.


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">VSX</FONT> instruction set (<B>-mvsx</B>, <B>-mcpu=power7</B>,
<B>-mcpu=power8</B>), or <B>-mcpu=power9</B> must be enabled to
use the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> 128-bit floating point support.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> 128-bit
floating point support only works on PowerPC Linux systems.


<P>


The default for <B>-mfloat128</B> is enabled on PowerPC Linux
systems using the <FONT SIZE="-1">VSX</FONT> instruction set, and disabled on other systems.


<P>


If you use the <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA 3.0</FONT> instruction set (<B>-mpower9-vector</B> or
<B>-mcpu=power9</B>) on a 64-bit system, the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> 128-bit floating
point support will also enable the generation of <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA 3.0 IEEE</FONT> 128-bit
floating point instructions.  Otherwise, if you do not specify to
generate <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA 3.0</FONT> instructions or you are targeting a 32-bit big endian
system, <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> 128-bit floating point will be done with software
emulation.
<DT id="3323"><B>-mfloat128-hardware</B><DD>



<DT id="3324"><B>-mno-float128-hardware</B><DD>



Enable/disable using <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA 3.0</FONT> hardware instructions to support the

<P>


The default for <B>-mfloat128-hardware</B> is enabled on PowerPC

<DT id="3325"><B>-m32</B><DD>



<DT id="3326"><B>-m64</B><DD>



Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin and <FONT SIZE="-1">SVR4</FONT>
targets (including GNU/Linux).  The 32-bit environment sets int, long
and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any PowerPC
variant.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and
pointer to 64 bits, and generates code for PowerPC64, as for
<B>-mpowerpc64</B>.
<DT id="3327"><B>-mfull-toc</B><DD>



<DT id="3328"><B>-mno-fp-in-toc</B><DD>


<DT id="3329"><B>-mno-sum-in-toc</B><DD>


<DT id="3330"><B>-mminimal-toc</B><DD>



Modify generation of the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The <B>-mfull-toc</B> option is selected by
default.  In that case, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> allocates at least one <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
also places floating-point constants in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC.</FONT>  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC.</FONT>


<P>


If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> space, you can reduce the amount of <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> space used
with the <B>-mno-fp-in-toc</B> and <B>-mno-sum-in-toc</B> options.
<B>-mno-fp-in-toc</B> prevents <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> from putting floating-point
constants in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> and <B>-mno-sum-in-toc</B> forces <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run time instead of putting that sum into the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC.</FONT>  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> space.


<P>


If you still run out of space in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> even when you specify both of
these options, specify <B>-mminimal-toc</B> instead.  This option causes
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to make only one <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> produces code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently-executed code.
<DT id="3331"><B>-maix64</B><DD>



<DT id="3332"><B>-maix32</B><DD>



Enable 64-bit <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX ABI</FONT> and calling convention: 64-bit pointers, 64-bit
<TT>&quot;long&quot;</TT> type, and the infrastructure needed to support them.
Specifying <B>-maix64</B> implies <B>-mpowerpc64</B>,
while <B>-maix32</B> disables the 64-bit <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> and
implies <B>-mno-powerpc64</B>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults to <B>-maix32</B>.
<DT id="3333"><B>-mxl-compat</B><DD>



<DT id="3334"><B>-mno-xl-compat</B><DD>



Produce code that conforms more closely to <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM XL</FONT> compiler semantics
when using AIX-compatible <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  Pass floating-point arguments to
prototyped functions beyond the register save area (<FONT SIZE="-1">RSA</FONT>) on the stack
in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume that most significant
double in 128-bit long double value is properly rounded when comparing
values and converting to double.  Use <FONT SIZE="-1">XL</FONT> symbol names for long double
support routines.


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM XL</FONT>
compilers access floating-point arguments that do not fit in the
<FONT SIZE="-1">RSA</FONT> from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the
stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
default and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM
XL</FONT> compilers without optimization.

<DT id="3336"><B>-malign-natural</B><DD>



<DT id="3337"><B>-malign-power</B><DD>



On <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX,</FONT> 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the option
<B>-malign-natural</B> overrides the ABI-defined alignment of larger
types, such as floating-point doubles, on their natural size-based boundary.
The option <B>-malign-power</B> instructs <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to follow the ABI-specified
alignment rules.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defaults to the standard alignment defined in the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>


<P>


On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and <B>-malign-power</B>
is not supported.
<DT id="3338"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>



<DT id="3339"><B>-mhard-float</B><DD>



Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register set.
Software floating-point emulation is provided if you use the
<B>-msoft-float</B> option, and pass the option to <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> when linking.
<DT id="3340"><B>-mmultiple</B><DD>



<DT id="3341"><B>-mno-multiple</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
instructions are generated by default on <FONT SIZE="-1">POWER</FONT> systems, and not
generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use <B>-mmultiple</B> on little-endian
PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work when the
processor is in little-endian mode.  The exceptions are <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC740</FONT> and
<FONT SIZE="-1">PPC750</FONT> which permit these instructions in little-endian mode.
<DT id="3342"><B>-mupdate</B><DD>



<DT id="3343"><B>-mno-update</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions
that update the base register to the address of the calculated memory
location.  These instructions are generated by default.  If you use
<B>-mno-update</B>, there is a small window between the time that the
stack pointer is updated and the address of the previous frame is
stored, which means code that walks the stack frame across interrupts or
signals may get corrupted data.
<DT id="3344"><B>-mavoid-indexed-addresses</B><DD>



<DT id="3345"><B>-mno-avoid-indexed-addresses</B><DD>



Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of indexed load
or store instructions. These instructions can incur a performance
penalty on Power6 processors in certain situations, such as when
stepping through large arrays that cross a 16M boundary.  This option
is enabled by default when targeting Power6 and disabled otherwise.
<DT id="3346"><B>-mfused-madd</B><DD>



<DT id="3347"><B>-mno-fused-madd</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply and
accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default
if hardware floating point is used.  The machine-dependent
<B>-mfused-madd</B> option is now mapped to the machine-independent
<B>-ffp-contract=fast</B> option, and <B>-mno-fused-madd</B> is
mapped to <B>-ffp-contract=off</B>.
<DT id="3348"><B>-mmulhw</B><DD>



<DT id="3349"><B>-mno-mulhw</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word multiply and
multiply-accumulate instructions on the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM 405, 440, 464</FONT> and 476 processors.
These instructions are generated by default when targeting those
processors.
<DT id="3350"><B>-mdlmzb</B><DD>



<DT id="3351"><B>-mno-dlmzb</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search <B>dlmzb</B>
instruction on the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM 405, 440, 464</FONT> and 476 processors.  This instruction is
generated by default when targeting those processors.
<DT id="3352"><B>-mno-bit-align</B><DD>



<DT id="3353"><B>-mbit-align</B><DD>



On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force structures
and unions that contain bit-fields to be aligned to the base type of the
bit-field.


<P>


For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8
<TT>&quot;unsigned&quot;</TT> bit-fields of length 1 is aligned to a 4-byte
boundary and has a size of 4 bytes.  By using <B>-mno-bit-align</B>,
the structure is aligned to a 1-byte boundary and is 1 byte in

<DT id="3354"><B>-mno-strict-align</B><DD>



<DT id="3355"><B>-mstrict-align</B><DD>

<DT id="3357"><B>-mno-relocatable</B><DD>



Generate code that allows (does not allow) a static executable to be
relocated to a different address at run time.  A simple embedded
PowerPC system loader should relocate the entire contents of
<TT>&quot;.got2&quot;</TT> and 4-byte locations listed in the <TT>&quot;.fixup&quot;</TT> section,
a table of 32-bit addresses generated by this option.  For this to
work, all objects linked together must be compiled with
<B>-mrelocatable</B> or <B>-mrelocatable-lib</B>.
<B>-mrelocatable</B> code aligns the stack to an 8-byte boundary.
<DT id="3358"><B>-mrelocatable-lib</B><DD>



<DT id="3359"><B>-mno-relocatable-lib</B><DD>



Like <B>-mrelocatable</B>, <B>-mrelocatable-lib</B> generates a
<TT>&quot;.fixup&quot;</TT> section to allow static executables to be relocated at
run time, but <B>-mrelocatable-lib</B> does not use the smaller stack
alignment of <B>-mrelocatable</B>.  Objects compiled with
<B>-mrelocatable-lib</B> may be linked with objects compiled with
any combination of the <B>-mrelocatable</B> options.

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to the
Embedded Applications Binary Interface (<FONT SIZE="-1">EABI</FONT>), which is a set of
modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting <B>-meabi</B>
means that the stack is aligned to an 8-byte boundary, a function
<TT>&quot;__eabi&quot;</TT> is called from <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT> to set up the <FONT SIZE="-1">EABI</FONT>

<B>-mno-eabi</B> means that the stack is aligned to a 16-byte boundary,
no <FONT SIZE="-1">EABI</FONT> initialization function is called from <TT>&quot;main&quot;</TT>, and the
<B>-msdata</B> option only uses <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT> to point to a single

Inline all block moves (such as calls to <TT>&quot;memcpy&quot;</TT> or structure
copies) less than or equal to <I>num</I> bytes.  The minimum value for
<I>num</I> is 32 bytes on 32-bit targets and 64 bytes on 64-bit

<DT id="3422"><B>-mblock-compare-inline-limit=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Generate non-looping inline code for all block compares (such as calls
to <TT>&quot;memcmp&quot;</TT> or structure compares) less than or equal to <I>num</I>
bytes. If <I>num</I> is 0, all inline expansion (non-loop and loop) of
block compare is disabled. The default value is target-specific.
<DT id="3423"><B>-mblock-compare-inline-loop-limit=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Generate an inline expansion using loop code for all block compares that
are less than or equal to <I>num</I> bytes, but greater than the limit
for non-loop inline block compare expansion. If the block length is not
constant, at most <I>num</I> bytes will be compared before <TT>&quot;memcmp&quot;</TT>
is called to compare the remainder of the block. The default value is
target-specific.
<DT id="3424"><B>-mstring-compare-inline-limit=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Compare at most <I>num</I> string bytes with inline code.
If the difference or end of string is not found at the
end of the inline compare a call to <TT>&quot;strcmp&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;strncmp&quot;</TT> will
take care of the rest of the comparison. The default is 64 bytes.
<DT id="3425"><B>-G</B> <I>num</I><DD>


On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items less than or

<DT id="3428"><B>-mlongcall</B><DD>



<DT id="3429"><B>-mno-longcall</B><DD>



By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and more
expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for calls
farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call is generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the <TT>&quot;shortcall&quot;</TT> function attribute, or by <TT>&quot;#pragma
longcall(0)&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> linker can do this,
as can the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.


<P>


On PowerPC64 ELFv2 and 32-bit PowerPC systems with newer <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> linkers,
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can generate long calls using an inline <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> call sequence (see
<B>-mpltseq</B>).  PowerPC with <B>-mbss-plt</B> and PowerPC64
ELFv1 (big-endian) do not support inline <FONT SIZE="-1">PLT</FONT> calls.


<P>


On Darwin/PPC systems, <TT>&quot;#pragma longcall&quot;</TT> generates <TT>&quot;jbsr
callee, L42&quot;</TT>, plus a <I>branch island</I> (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the branch island.  The
Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and generates a <TT>&quot;bl
callee&quot;</TT> if the <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC</FONT> <TT>&quot;bl&quot;</TT> instruction reaches the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker generates <TT>&quot;bl L42&quot;</TT> to call the branch
island.  The branch island is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.


<P>


On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.


<P>


In the future, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> may ignore all longcall specifications
when the linker is known to generate glue.
<DT id="3430"><B>-mpltseq</B><DD>

<DT id="3433"><B>-mno-tls-markers</B><DD>



Mark (do not mark) calls to <TT>&quot;__tls_get_addr&quot;</TT> with a relocation
specifying the function argument.  The relocation allows the linker to
reliably associate function call with argument setup instructions for
<FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> optimization, which in turn allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to better schedule the
sequence.
<DT id="3434"><B>-mrecip</B><DD>



<DT id="3435"><B>-mno-recip</B><DD>



This option enables use of the reciprocal estimate and
reciprocal square root estimate instructions with additional
Newton-Raphson steps to increase precision instead of doing a divide or
square root and divide for floating-point arguments.  You should use
the <B>-ffast-math</B> option when using <B>-mrecip</B> (or at
least <B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B>,
<B>-ffinite-math-only</B>, <B>-freciprocal-math</B> and
<B>-fno-trapping-math</B>).  Note that while the throughput of the
sequence is generally higher than the throughput of the non-reciprocal
instruction, the precision of the sequence can be decreased by up to 2
ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994) for reciprocal square
roots.
<DT id="3436"><B>-mrecip=</B><I>opt</I><DD>

<DT id="3451"><B>-mfriz</B><DD>



<DT id="3452"><B>-mno-friz</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) the <TT>&quot;friz&quot;</TT> instruction when the
<B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> option is used to optimize
rounding of floating-point values to 64-bit integer and back to floating
point.  The <TT>&quot;friz&quot;</TT> instruction does not return the same value if
the floating-point number is too large to fit in an integer.
<DT id="3453"><B>-mpointers-to-nested-functions</B><DD>



<DT id="3454"><B>-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) code to load up the static chain register
(<TT>&quot;r11&quot;</TT>) when calling through a pointer on <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> and 64-bit Linux
systems where a function pointer points to a 3-word descriptor giving
the function address, <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> value to be loaded in register <TT>&quot;r2&quot;</TT>, and
static chain value to be loaded in register <TT>&quot;r11&quot;</TT>.  The
<B>-mpointers-to-nested-functions</B> is on by default.  You cannot
call through pointers to nested functions or pointers
to functions compiled in other languages that use the static chain if
you use <B>-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions</B>.
<DT id="3455"><B>-msave-toc-indirect</B><DD>



<DT id="3456"><B>-mno-save-toc-indirect</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) code to save the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> value in the reserved
stack location in the function prologue if the function calls through
a pointer on <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> and 64-bit Linux systems.  If the <FONT SIZE="-1">TOC</FONT> value is not
saved in the prologue, it is saved just before the call through the
pointer.  The <B>-mno-save-toc-indirect</B> option is the default.
<DT id="3457"><B>-mcompat-align-parm</B><DD>



<DT id="3458"><B>-mno-compat-align-parm</B><DD>



Generate (do not generate) code to pass structure parameters with a
maximum alignment of 64 bits, for compatibility with older versions
of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>


<P>


Older versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> (prior to 4.9.0) incorrectly did not align a
structure parameter on a 128-bit boundary when that structure contained
a member requiring 128-bit alignment.  This is corrected in more
recent versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  This option may be used to generate code
that is compatible with functions compiled with older versions of
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>


<P>


The <B>-mno-compat-align-parm</B> option is the default.
<DT id="3459"><B>-mstack-protector-guard=</B><I>guard</I><DD>



<DT id="3460"><B>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</B><I>reg</I><DD>

<DT id="3462"><B>-mstack-protector-guard-symbol=</B><I>symbol</I><DD>



Generate stack protection code using canary at <I>guard</I>.  Supported
locations are <B>global</B> for global canary or <B>tls</B> for per-thread
canary in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> block (the default with <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> libc version 2.4 or later).


<P>


With the latter choice the options
<B>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</B><I>reg</I> and
<B>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</B><I>offset</I> furthermore specify
which register to use as base register for reading the canary, and from what
offset from that base register. The default for those is as specified in the
relevant <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  <B>-mstack-protector-guard-symbol=</B><I>symbol</I> overrides
the offset with a symbol reference to a canary in the <FONT SIZE="-1">TLS</FONT> block.
</DL>
<P>

<I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>RX</I></FONT><I> Options</I>


<P>

These command-line options are defined for <FONT SIZE="-1">RX</FONT> targets:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3463"><B>-m64bit-doubles</B><DD>



<DT id="3464"><B>-m32bit-doubles</B><DD>



Make the <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> data type be 64 bits (<B>-m64bit-doubles</B>)
or 32 bits (<B>-m32bit-doubles</B>) in size.  The default is
<B>-m32bit-doubles</B>.  <I>Note</I> <FONT SIZE="-1">RX</FONT> floating-point hardware only
works on 32-bit values, which is why the default is
<B>-m32bit-doubles</B>.
<DT id="3465"><B>-fpu</B><DD>



<DT id="3466"><B>-nofpu</B><DD>



Enables (<B>-fpu</B>) or disables (<B>-nofpu</B>) the use of <FONT SIZE="-1">RX</FONT>
floating-point hardware.  The default is enabled for the <FONT SIZE="-1">RX600</FONT>
series and disabled for the <FONT SIZE="-1">RX200</FONT> series.


<P>


Floating-point instructions are only generated for 32-bit floating-point 
values, however, so the <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> hardware is not used for doubles if the
<B>-m64bit-doubles</B> option is used.


<P>


<I>Note</I> If the <B>-fpu</B> option is enabled then
<B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> is also enabled automatically.
This is because the <FONT SIZE="-1">RX FPU</FONT> instructions are themselves unsafe.
<DT id="3467"><B>-mcpu=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Selects the type of <FONT SIZE="-1">RX CPU</FONT> to be targeted.  Currently three types are
supported, the generic <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RX600</B></FONT><B></B> and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RX200</B></FONT><B></B> series hardware and
the specific <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RX610</B></FONT><B></B> <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU.</FONT>  The default is <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RX600</B></FONT><B></B>.


<P>


The only difference between <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RX600</B></FONT><B></B> and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RX610</B></FONT><B></B> is that the
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RX610</B></FONT><B></B> does not support the <TT>&quot;MVTIPL&quot;</TT> instruction.


<P>


The <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RX200</B></FONT><B></B> series does not have a hardware floating-point unit
and so <B>-nofpu</B> is enabled by default when this type is
selected.
<DT id="3468"><B>-mbig-endian-data</B><DD>



<DT id="3469"><B>-mlittle-endian-data</B><DD>



Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format.  The default is
<B>-mlittle-endian-data</B>, i.e. to store data in the little-endian
format.
<DT id="3470"><B>-msmall-data-limit=</B><I>N</I><DD>


Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the <FONT SIZE="-1">RX</FONT>'s
registers (usually <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT>) is reserved for use pointing to this
area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed onto
the stack instead of being held in this register.


<P>


Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized) and
constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned
to other sections in the output executable.


<P>


The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
(<B>-O2</B> etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and
discover whether this feature is of benefit to their program.  See the
description of the <B>-mpid</B> option for a description of how the
actual register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.
<DT id="3471"><B>-msim</B><DD>



<DT id="3472"><B>-mno-sim</B><DD>



Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss
board-specific runtime.
<DT id="3473"><B>-mas100-syntax</B><DD>



<DT id="3474"><B>-mno-as100-syntax</B><DD>



When generating assembler output use a syntax that is compatible with
Renesas's <FONT SIZE="-1">AS100</FONT> assembler.  This syntax can also be handled by the <FONT SIZE="-1">GAS</FONT>
assembler, but it has some restrictions so it is not generated by default.
<DT id="3475"><B>-mmax-constant-size=</B><I>N</I><DD>


Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as
an operand in a <FONT SIZE="-1">RX</FONT> instruction.  Although the <FONT SIZE="-1">RX</FONT> instruction set does
allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions,
a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some
circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants
that are used in instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead
placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.


<P>


The value <I>N</I> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default)
or 4 means that constants of any size are allowed.
<DT id="3476"><B>-mrelax</B><DD>


Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby the
linker attempts to reduce the size of a program by finding shorter
versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.
<DT id="3477"><B>-mint-register=</B><I>N</I><DD>


Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler
functions.  The value <I>N</I> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1
means that register <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT> is reserved for the exclusive use
of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;r12&quot;</TT>.  A value of 3 reserves <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;r12&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;r11&quot;</TT>, and a value of 4 reserves <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT> through <TT>&quot;r10&quot;</TT>.
A value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.
<DT id="3478"><B>-msave-acc-in-interrupts</B><DD>


Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64-bit
multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator as this
makes the interrupt handlers faster.
<DT id="3479"><B>-mpid</B><DD>



<DT id="3480"><B>-mno-pid</B><DD>



Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled any
access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address
held in a register.  This allows the location of constant data to be
determined at run time without requiring the executable to be
relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight
memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by this
option.


<P>


Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT>, for
the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated functions.


<P>


The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address
depends upon whether the <B>-msmall-data-limit</B> and/or the
<B>-mint-register</B> command-line options are enabled.  Starting
with register <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT> and proceeding downwards, registers are
allocated first to satisfy the requirements of <B>-mint-register</B>,
then <B>-mpid</B> and finally <B>-msmall-data-limit</B>.  Thus it
is possible for the small data area register to be <TT>&quot;r8&quot;</TT> if both
<B>-mint-register=4</B> and <B>-mpid</B> are specified on the
command line.


<P>


By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be restored
via the <B>-mno-pid</B> command-line option.
<DT id="3481"><B>-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts</B><DD>



<DT id="3482"><B>-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts</B><DD>



Prevents <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> from issuing a warning message if it finds more than one
fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.  The default is to
issue a warning for each extra fast interrupt handler found, as the <FONT SIZE="-1">RX</FONT>
only supports one such interrupt.
<DT id="3483"><B>-mallow-string-insns</B><DD>



<DT id="3484"><B>-mno-allow-string-insns</B><DD>



Enables or disables the use of the string manipulation instructions
<TT>&quot;SMOVF&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;SCMPU&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;SMOVB&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;SMOVU&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;SUNTIL&quot;</TT>
<TT>&quot;SWHILE&quot;</TT> and also the <TT>&quot;RMPA&quot;</TT> instruction.  These
instructions may prefetch data, which is not safe to do if accessing
an I/O register.  (See section 12.2.7 of the <FONT SIZE="-1">RX62N</FONT> Group User's Manual
for more information).


<P>


The default is to allow these instructions, but it is not possible for
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to reliably detect all circumstances where a string instruction
might be used to access an I/O register, so their use cannot be
disabled automatically.  Instead it is reliant upon the programmer to
use the <B>-mno-allow-string-insns</B> option if their program
accesses I/O space.


<P>


When the instructions are enabled <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> defines the C preprocessor
symbol <TT>&quot;__RX_ALLOW_STRING_INSNS__&quot;</TT>, otherwise it defines the
symbol <TT>&quot;__RX_DISALLOW_STRING_INSNS__&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="3485"><B>-mjsr</B><DD>



<DT id="3486"><B>-mno-jsr</B><DD>



Use only (or not only) <TT>&quot;JSR&quot;</TT> instructions to access functions.
This option can be used when code size exceeds the range of <TT>&quot;BSR&quot;</TT>
instructions.  Note that <B>-mno-jsr</B> does not mean to not use
<TT>&quot;JSR&quot;</TT> but instead means that any type of branch may be used.
</DL>
<P>

<I>Note:</I> The generic <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> command-line option <B>-ffixed-</B><I>reg</I>
has special significance to the <FONT SIZE="-1">RX</FONT> port when used with the
<TT>&quot;interrupt&quot;</TT> function attribute.  This attribute indicates a
function intended to process fast interrupts.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> ensures
that it only uses the registers <TT>&quot;r10&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;r11&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;r12&quot;</TT>
and/or <TT>&quot;r13&quot;</TT> and only provided that the normal use of the
corresponding registers have been restricted via the
<B>-ffixed-</B><I>reg</I> or <B>-mint-register</B> command-line
options.
<P>

<I>S/390 and zSeries Options</I>


<P>

These are the <B>-m</B> options defined for the S/390 and zSeries architecture.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3487"><B>-mhard-float</B><DD>



<DT id="3488"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>



Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions and registers
for floating-point operations.  When <B>-msoft-float</B> is specified,
functions in <I>libgcc.a</I> are used to perform floating-point
operations.  When <B>-mhard-float</B> is specified, the compiler
generates <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> floating-point instructions.  This is the default.
<DT id="3489"><B>-mhard-dfp</B><DD>



<DT id="3490"><B>-mno-hard-dfp</B><DD>



Use (do not use) the hardware decimal-floating-point instructions for
decimal-floating-point operations.  When <B>-mno-hard-dfp</B> is
specified, functions in <I>libgcc.a</I> are used to perform
decimal-floating-point operations.  When <B>-mhard-dfp</B> is
specified, the compiler generates decimal-floating-point hardware
instructions.  This is the default for <B>-march=z9-ec</B> or higher.
<DT id="3491"><B>-mlong-double-64</B><DD>



<DT id="3492"><B>-mlong-double-128</B><DD>



These switches control the size of <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> type. A size
of 64 bits makes the <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> type equivalent to the <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>
type. This is the default.
<DT id="3493"><B>-mbackchain</B><DD>



<DT id="3494"><B>-mno-backchain</B><DD>



Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer
into the callee's stack frame.
A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand
<FONT SIZE="-1">DWARF</FONT> call frame information.
When <B>-mno-packed-stack</B> is in effect, the backchain pointer is stored
at the bottom of the stack frame; when <B>-mpacked-stack</B> is in effect,
the backchain is placed into the topmost word of the 96/160 byte register
save area.


<P>


In general, code compiled with <B>-mbackchain</B> is call-compatible with
code compiled with <B>-mmo-backchain</B>; however, use of the backchain
for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole binary is built with
<B>-mbackchain</B>.  Note that the combination of <B>-mbackchain</B>,
<B>-mpacked-stack</B> and <B>-mhard-float</B> is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use <B>-msoft-float</B>.


<P>


The default is to not maintain the backchain.
<DT id="3495"><B>-mpacked-stack</B><DD>



<DT id="3496"><B>-mno-packed-stack</B><DD>



Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When <B>-mno-packed-stack</B> is
specified, the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte register save
area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space.
When <B>-mpacked-stack</B> is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space.
However, when <B>-mbackchain</B> is also in effect, the topmost word of
the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.


<P>


As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with
<B>-mpacked-stack</B> is call-compatible with code generated with
<B>-mno-packed-stack</B>.  Note that some non-FSF releases of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 2.95</FONT> for
S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run
time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible
with code compiled with <B>-mpacked-stack</B>.  Also, note that the
combination of <B>-mbackchain</B>,
<B>-mpacked-stack</B> and <B>-mhard-float</B> is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use <B>-msoft-float</B>.


<P>


The default is to not use the packed stack layout.
<DT id="3497"><B>-msmall-exec</B><DD>



<DT id="3498"><B>-mno-small-exec</B><DD>



Generate (or do not generate) code using the <TT>&quot;bras&quot;</TT> instruction
to do subroutine calls.
This only works reliably if the total executable size does not
exceed 64k.  The default is to use the <TT>&quot;basr&quot;</TT> instruction instead,
which does not have this limitation.
<DT id="3499"><B>-m64</B><DD>



<DT id="3500"><B>-m31</B><DD>



When <B>-m31</B> is specified, generate code compliant to the
GNU/Linux for S/390 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  When <B>-m64</B> is specified, generate
code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  This allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> in
particular to generate 64-bit instructions.  For the <B>s390</B>
targets, the default is <B>-m31</B>, while the <B>s390x</B>
targets default to <B>-m64</B>.
<DT id="3501"><B>-mzarch</B><DD>



<DT id="3502"><B>-mesa</B><DD>



When <B>-mzarch</B> is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on z/Architecture.
When <B>-mesa</B> is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on <FONT SIZE="-1">ESA/390.</FONT>  Note that <B>-mesa</B> is
not possible with <B>-m64</B>.
When generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT>
the default is <B>-mesa</B>.  When generating code compliant
to the GNU/Linux for zSeries <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> the default is <B>-mzarch</B>.
<DT id="3503"><B>-mhtm</B><DD>



<DT id="3504"><B>-mno-htm</B><DD>



The <B>-mhtm</B> option enables a set of builtins making use of
instructions available with the transactional execution facility
introduced with the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT> zEnterprise <FONT SIZE="-1">EC12</FONT> machine generation
<B>S/390 System z Built-in Functions</B>.
<B>-mhtm</B> is enabled by default when using <B>-march=zEC12</B>.
<DT id="3505"><B>-mvx</B><DD>



<DT id="3506"><B>-mno-vx</B><DD>



When <B>-mvx</B> is specified, generate code using the instructions
available with the vector extension facility introduced with the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT>
z13 machine generation.
This option changes the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> for some vector type values with regard to
alignment and calling conventions.  In case vector type values are
being used in an ABI-relevant context a <FONT SIZE="-1">GAS</FONT> <B>.gnu_attribute</B>
command will be added to mark the resulting binary with the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> used.
<B>-mvx</B> is enabled by default when using <B>-march=z13</B>.
<DT id="3507"><B>-mzvector</B><DD>



<DT id="3508"><B>-mno-zvector</B><DD>



The <B>-mzvector</B> option enables vector language extensions and
builtins using instructions available with the vector extension
facility introduced with the <FONT SIZE="-1">IBM</FONT> z13 machine generation.
This option adds support for <B>vector</B> to be used as a keyword to
define vector type variables and arguments.  <B>vector</B> is only
available when <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extensions are enabled.  It will not be expanded
when requesting strict standard compliance e.g. with <B>-std=c99</B>.
In addition to the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> low-level builtins <B>-mzvector</B> enables
a set of builtins added for compatibility with AltiVec-style
implementations like Power and Cell.  In order to make use of these
builtins the header file <I>vecintrin.h</I> needs to be included.
<B>-mzvector</B> is disabled by default.
<DT id="3509"><B>-mmvcle</B><DD>



<DT id="3510"><B>-mno-mvcle</B><DD>



Generate (or do not generate) code using the <TT>&quot;mvcle&quot;</TT> instruction
to perform block moves.  When <B>-mno-mvcle</B> is specified,
use a <TT>&quot;mvc&quot;</TT> loop instead.  This is the default unless optimizing for
size.
<DT id="3511"><B>-mdebug</B><DD>



<DT id="3512"><B>-mno-debug</B><DD>



Print (or do not print) additional debug information when compiling.
The default is to not print debug information.
<DT id="3513"><B>-march=</B><I>cpu-type</I><DD>


Generate code that runs on <I>cpu-type</I>, which is the name of a
system representing a certain processor type.  Possible values for
<I>cpu-type</I> are <B>z900</B>/<B>arch5</B>, <B>z990</B>/<B>arch6</B>,
<B>z9-109</B>, <B>z9-ec</B>/<B>arch7</B>, <B>z10</B>/<B>arch8</B>,

<B>z14</B>/<B>arch12</B>, and <B>native</B>.


<P>


The default is <B>-march=z900</B>.


<P>


Specifying <B>native</B> as cpu type can be used to select the best
architecture option for the host processor.
<B>-march=native</B> has no effect if <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not recognize the
processor.
<DT id="3514"><B>-mtune=</B><I>cpu-type</I><DD>


Tune to <I>cpu-type</I> everything applicable about the generated code,
except for the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> and the set of available instructions.
The list of <I>cpu-type</I> values is the same as for <B>-march</B>.
The default is the value used for <B>-march</B>.
<DT id="3515"><B>-mtpf-trace</B><DD>



<DT id="3516"><B>-mno-tpf-trace</B><DD>



Generate code that adds (does not add) in <FONT SIZE="-1">TPF OS</FONT> specific branches to trace
routines in the operating system.  This option is off by default, even
when compiling for the <FONT SIZE="-1">TPF OS.</FONT>
<DT id="3517"><B>-mfused-madd</B><DD>



<DT id="3518"><B>-mno-fused-madd</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply and
accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default if
hardware floating point is used.
<DT id="3519"><B>-mwarn-framesize=</B><I>framesize</I><DD>


Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given frame size.  Because
this is a compile-time check it doesn't need to be a real problem when the program
runs.  It is intended to identify functions that most probably cause
a stack overflow.  It is useful to be used in an environment with limited stack
size e.g. the linux kernel.
<DT id="3520"><B>-mwarn-dynamicstack</B><DD>


Emit a warning if the function calls <TT>&quot;alloca&quot;</TT> or uses dynamically-sized
arrays.  This is generally a bad idea with a limited stack size.
<DT id="3521"><B>-mstack-guard=</B><I>stack-guard</I><DD>



<DT id="3522"><B>-mstack-size=</B><I>stack-size</I><DD>



If these options are provided the S/390 back end emits additional instructions in
the function prologue that trigger a trap if the stack size is <I>stack-guard</I>
bytes above the <I>stack-size</I> (remember that the stack on S/390 grows downward).
If the <I>stack-guard</I> option is omitted the smallest power of 2 larger than
the frame size of the compiled function is chosen.
These options are intended to be used to help debugging stack overflow problems.
The additionally emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can also be
used in production-like systems without greater performance degradation.  The given
values have to be exact powers of 2 and <I>stack-size</I> has to be greater than
<I>stack-guard</I> without exceeding 64k.
In order to be efficient the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts
at an address aligned to the value given by <I>stack-size</I>.
The <I>stack-guard</I> option can only be used in conjunction with <I>stack-size</I>.
<DT id="3523"><B>-mhotpatch=</B><I>pre-halfwords</I><B>,</B><I>post-halfwords</I><DD>


If the hotpatch option is enabled, a ``hot-patching'' function
prologue is generated for all functions in the compilation unit.
The funtion label is prepended with the given number of two-byte
<FONT SIZE="-1">NOP</FONT> instructions (<I>pre-halfwords</I>, maximum 1000000).  After
the label, 2 * <I>post-halfwords</I> bytes are appended, using the
largest <FONT SIZE="-1">NOP</FONT> like instructions the architecture allows (maximum
1000000).


<P>


If both arguments are zero, hotpatching is disabled.

This option can be overridden for individual functions with the

<DT id="3565"><B>-mb</B><DD>


Compile code for the processor in big-endian mode.
<DT id="3566"><B>-ml</B><DD>


Compile code for the processor in little-endian mode.
<DT id="3567"><B>-mdalign</B><DD>


Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries.  Note that this changes the calling
conventions, and thus some functions from the standard C library do
not work unless you recompile it first with <B>-mdalign</B>.
<DT id="3568"><B>-mrelax</B><DD>


Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses the
linker option <B>-relax</B>.
<DT id="3569"><B>-mbigtable</B><DD>


Use 32-bit offsets in <TT>&quot;switch&quot;</TT> tables.  The default is to use
16-bit offsets.
<DT id="3570"><B>-mbitops</B><DD>


Enable the use of bit manipulation instructions on <FONT SIZE="-1">SH2A.</FONT>
<DT id="3571"><B>-mfmovd</B><DD>

<DT id="3572"><B>-mrenesas</B><DD>


Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.
<DT id="3573"><B>-mno-renesas</B><DD>


Comply with the calling conventions defined for <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> before the Renesas
conventions were available.  This option is the default for all
targets of the <FONT SIZE="-1">SH</FONT> toolchain.
<DT id="3574"><B>-mnomacsave</B><DD>


Mark the <TT>&quot;MAC&quot;</TT> register as call-clobbered, even if
<B>-mrenesas</B> is given.
<DT id="3575"><B>-mieee</B><DD>



<DT id="3576"><B>-mno-ieee</B><DD>



Control the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> compliance of floating-point comparisons, which affects the
handling of cases where the result of a comparison is unordered.  By default
<B>-mieee</B> is implicitly enabled.  If <B>-ffinite-math-only</B> is
enabled <B>-mno-ieee</B> is implicitly set, which results in faster
floating-point greater-equal and less-equal comparisons.  The implicit settings
can be overridden by specifying either <B>-mieee</B> or <B>-mno-ieee</B>.
<DT id="3577"><B>-minline-ic_invalidate</B><DD>


Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after setting up
nested function trampolines.
This option has no effect if <B>-musermode</B> is in effect and the selected
code generation option (e.g. <B>-m4</B>) does not allow the use of the <TT>&quot;icbi&quot;</TT>
instruction.
If the selected code generation option does not allow the use of the <TT>&quot;icbi&quot;</TT>
instruction, and <B>-musermode</B> is not in effect, the inlined code
manipulates the instruction cache address array directly with an associative
write.  This not only requires privileged mode at run time, but it also
fails if the cache line had been mapped via the <FONT SIZE="-1">TLB</FONT> and has become unmapped.
<DT id="3578"><B>-misize</B><DD>


Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.
<DT id="3579"><B>-mpadstruct</B><DD>


This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of 4 bytes,
which is incompatible with the <FONT SIZE="-1">SH ABI.</FONT>
<DT id="3580"><B>-matomic-model=</B><I>model</I><DD>


Sets the model of atomic operations and additional parameters as a comma
separated list.  For details on the atomic built-in functions see
<B>__atomic Builtins</B>.  The following models and parameters are supported:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3581"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3582"><B>none</B><DD>


Disable compiler generated atomic sequences and emit library calls for atomic
operations.  This is the default if the target is not <TT>&quot;sh*-*-linux*&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="3583"><B>soft-gusa</B><DD>


Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences for the atomic
built-in functions.  The generated atomic sequences require additional support
from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only suitable
for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option is enabled by default when
the target is <TT>&quot;sh*-*-linux*&quot;</TT> and SH3* or SH4*.  When the target is <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4A,</FONT>
this option also partially utilizes the hardware atomic instructions
<TT>&quot;movli.l&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;movco.l&quot;</TT> to create more efficient code, unless
<B>strict</B> is specified.
<DT id="3584"><B>soft-tcb</B><DD>


Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in the thread control
block.  This is a variation of the gUSA sequences which can also be used on
SH1* and SH2* targets.  The generated atomic sequences require additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
suitable for single-core systems.  When using this model, the <B>gbr-offset=</B>
parameter has to be specified as well.
<DT id="3585"><B>soft-imask</B><DD>


Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable interrupts by
setting <TT>&quot;SR.IMASK = 1111&quot;</TT>.  This model works only when the program runs
in privileged mode and is only suitable for single-core systems.  Additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not
required.  This model is enabled by default when the target is
<TT>&quot;sh*-*-linux*&quot;</TT> and SH1* or SH2*.
<DT id="3586"><B>hard-llcs</B><DD>


Generate hardware atomic sequences using the <TT>&quot;movli.l&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;movco.l&quot;</TT>
instructions only.  This is only available on <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4A</FONT> and is suitable for
multi-core systems.  Since the hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic
variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses.
Code compiled with this option is also compatible with other software
atomic model interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4A</FONT>
system.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the
system is not required for this model.
<DT id="3587"><B>gbr-offset=</B><DD>


This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the variable in the thread
control block structure that should be used by the generated atomic sequences
when the <B>soft-tcb</B> model has been selected.  For other models this
parameter is ignored.  The specified value must be an integer multiple of four
and in the range 0-1020.
<DT id="3588"><B>strict</B><DD>


This parameter prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic models, even if they
are compatible, and makes the compiler generate atomic sequences of the
specified model only.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="3589"><DD>
</DL>

<DT id="3590"><B>-mtas</B><DD>


Generate the <TT>&quot;tas.b&quot;</TT> opcode for <TT>&quot;__atomic_test_and_set&quot;</TT>.
Notice that depending on the particular hardware and software configuration
this can degrade overall performance due to the operand cache line flushes
that are implied by the <TT>&quot;tas.b&quot;</TT> instruction.  On multi-core <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4A</FONT>
processors the <TT>&quot;tas.b&quot;</TT> instruction must be used with caution since it
can result in data corruption for certain cache configurations.
<DT id="3591"><B>-mprefergot</B><DD>


When generating position-independent code, emit function calls using
the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure Linkage Table.
<DT id="3592"><B>-musermode</B><DD>



<DT id="3593"><B>-mno-usermode</B><DD>



Don't allow (allow) the compiler generating privileged mode code.  Specifying
<B>-musermode</B> also implies <B>-mno-inline-ic_invalidate</B> if the
inlined code would not work in user mode.  <B>-musermode</B> is the default
when the target is <TT>&quot;sh*-*-linux*&quot;</TT>.  If the target is SH1* or SH2*
<B>-musermode</B> has no effect, since there is no user mode.
<DT id="3594"><B>-multcost=</B><I>number</I><DD>


Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.
<DT id="3595"><B>-mdiv=</B><I>strategy</I><DD>


Set the division strategy to be used for integer division operations.
<I>strategy</I> can be one of:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3596"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3597"><B>call-div1</B><DD>


Calls a library function that uses the single-step division instruction
<TT>&quot;div1&quot;</TT> to perform the operation.  Division by zero calculates an
unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the default except for <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4,
SH2A</FONT> and SHcompact.
<DT id="3598"><B>call-fp</B><DD>


Calls a library function that performs the operation in double precision
floating point.  Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.  This is
the default for SHcompact with <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU.</FONT>  Specifying this for targets that do not
have a double precision <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> defaults to <TT>&quot;call-div1&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="3599"><B>call-table</B><DD>


Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small divisors and
the <TT>&quot;div1&quot;</TT> instruction with case distinction for larger divisors.  Division
by zero calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the default
for <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4.</FONT>  Specifying this for targets that do not have dynamic shift
instructions defaults to <TT>&quot;call-div1&quot;</TT>.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="3600"><DD>


<P>


When a division strategy has not been specified the default strategy is
selected based on the current target.  For <FONT SIZE="-1">SH2A</FONT> the default strategy is to
use the <TT>&quot;divs&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;divu&quot;</TT> instructions instead of library function
calls.
</DL>

<DT id="3601"><B>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</B><DD>


Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function prologue rather
than around each call.  Generally beneficial for performance and size.  Also
needed for unwinding to avoid changing the stack frame around conditional code.
<DT id="3602"><B>-mdivsi3_libfunc=</B><I>name</I><DD>


Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed division to
<I>name</I>.
This only affects the name used in the <B>call</B> division strategies, and
the compiler still expects the same sets of input/output/clobbered registers as
if this option were not present.
<DT id="3603"><B>-mfixed-range=</B><I>register-range</I><DD>


Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
<DT id="3604"><B>-mbranch-cost=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Assume <I>num</I> to be the cost for a branch instruction.  Higher numbers
make the compiler try to generate more branch-free code if possible.  
If not specified the value is selected depending on the processor type that
is being compiled for.
<DT id="3605"><B>-mzdcbranch</B><DD>



<DT id="3606"><B>-mno-zdcbranch</B><DD>



Assume (do not assume) that zero displacement conditional branch instructions
<TT>&quot;bt&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;bf&quot;</TT> are fast.  If <B>-mzdcbranch</B> is specified, the
compiler prefers zero displacement branch code sequences.  This is
enabled by default when generating code for <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4A.</FONT>  It can be explicitly
disabled by specifying <B>-mno-zdcbranch</B>.
<DT id="3607"><B>-mcbranch-force-delay-slot</B><DD>


Force the usage of delay slots for conditional branches, which stuffs the delay
slot with a <TT>&quot;nop&quot;</TT> if a suitable instruction cannot be found.  By default
this option is disabled.  It can be enabled to work around hardware bugs as
found in the original <FONT SIZE="-1">SH7055.</FONT>
<DT id="3608"><B>-mfused-madd</B><DD>



<DT id="3609"><B>-mno-fused-madd</B><DD>



Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply and
accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default
if hardware floating point is used.  The machine-dependent
<B>-mfused-madd</B> option is now mapped to the machine-independent
<B>-ffp-contract=fast</B> option, and <B>-mno-fused-madd</B> is
mapped to <B>-ffp-contract=off</B>.
<DT id="3610"><B>-mfsca</B><DD>



<DT id="3611"><B>-mno-fsca</B><DD>



Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the <TT>&quot;fsca&quot;</TT> instruction for sine
and cosine approximations.  The option <B>-mfsca</B> must be used in
combination with <B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B>.  It is enabled by default
when generating code for <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4A.</FONT>  Using <B>-mno-fsca</B> disables sine and cosine
approximations even if <B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> is in effect.
<DT id="3612"><B>-mfsrra</B><DD>



<DT id="3613"><B>-mno-fsrra</B><DD>



Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the <TT>&quot;fsrra&quot;</TT> instruction for
reciprocal square root approximations.  The option <B>-mfsrra</B> must be used
in combination with <B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> and
<B>-ffinite-math-only</B>.  It is enabled by default when generating code for
<FONT SIZE="-1">SH4A.</FONT>  Using <B>-mno-fsrra</B> disables reciprocal square root approximations
even if <B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> and <B>-ffinite-math-only</B> are
in effect.
<DT id="3614"><B>-mpretend-cmove</B><DD>


Prefer zero-displacement conditional branches for conditional move instruction
patterns.  This can result in faster code on the <FONT SIZE="-1">SH4</FONT> processor.

These <B>-m</B> options are supported on Solaris 2:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3616"><B>-mclear-hwcap</B><DD>


<B>-mclear-hwcap</B> tells the compiler to remove the hardware
capabilities generated by the Solaris assembler.  This is only necessary
when object files use <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> extensions not supported by the current
machine, but check at runtime whether or not to use them.
<DT id="3617"><B>-mimpure-text</B><DD>


<B>-mimpure-text</B>, used in addition to <B>-shared</B>, tells
the compiler to not pass <B>-z text</B> to the linker when linking a
shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent
code into a shared object.


<P>


<B>-mimpure-text</B> suppresses the ``relocations remain against
allocatable but non-writable sections'' linker error message.
However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
using <B>-mimpure-text</B>, you should compile all source code with
<B>-fpic</B> or <B>-fPIC</B>.

<DT id="3622"><B>-mno-flat</B><DD>



With <B>-mflat</B>, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and uses a ``flat'' or single register window model.  This model is compatible
with the regular register window model.  The local registers and the input
registers (0--5) are still treated as ``call-saved'' registers and are
saved on the stack as needed.


<P>


With <B>-mno-flat</B> (the default), the compiler generates save/restore
instructions (except for leaf functions).  This is the normal operating mode.
<DT id="3623"><B>-mfpu</B><DD>



<DT id="3624"><B>-mhard-float</B><DD>



Generate output containing floating-point instructions.  This is the
default.
<DT id="3625"><B>-mno-fpu</B><DD>



<DT id="3626"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>



Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<B>Warning:</B> the requisite libraries are not available for all <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT>
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets <B>sparc-*-aout</B> and
<B>sparclite-*-*</B> do provide software floating-point support.


<P>


<B>-msoft-float</B> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <I>all</I> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <I>libgcc.a</I>, the
library that comes with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> with <B>-msoft-float</B> in order for
this to work.
<DT id="3627"><B>-mhard-quad-float</B><DD>


Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point
instructions.
<DT id="3628"><B>-msoft-quad-float</B><DD>


Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC ABI.</FONT>  This is the default.


<P>


As of this writing, there are no <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT> implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> library routines.  Thus the
<B>-msoft-quad-float</B> option is the default.
<DT id="3629"><B>-mno-unaligned-doubles</B><DD>



<DT id="3630"><B>-munaligned-doubles</B><DD>



Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment.  This is the default.


<P>


With <B>-munaligned-doubles</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> assumes that doubles have 8-byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4-byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating-point code.
<DT id="3631"><B>-muser-mode</B><DD>



<DT id="3632"><B>-mno-user-mode</B><DD>



Do not generate code that can only run in supervisor mode.  This is relevant
only for the <TT>&quot;casa&quot;</TT> instruction emitted for the <FONT SIZE="-1">LEON3</FONT> processor.  This
is the default.
<DT id="3633"><B>-mfaster-structs</B><DD>



<DT id="3634"><B>-mno-faster-structs</B><DD>



With <B>-mfaster-structs</B>, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
<TT>&quot;ldd&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;std&quot;</TT> instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many <TT>&quot;ld&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;st&quot;</TT> pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC
ABI.</FONT>  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code is not directly in line with
the rules of the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>
<DT id="3635"><B>-mstd-struct-return</B><DD>



<DT id="3636"><B>-mno-std-struct-return</B><DD>



With <B>-mstd-struct-return</B>, the compiler generates checking code
in functions returning structures or unions to detect size mismatches
between the two sides of function calls, as per the 32-bit <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>


<P>


The default is <B>-mno-std-struct-return</B>.  This option has no effect
in 64-bit mode.
<DT id="3637"><B>-mlra</B><DD>



<DT id="3638"><B>-mno-lra</B><DD>



Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is the default for <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT> since <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 7</FONT>
so <B>-mno-lra</B> needs to be passed to get old Reload.
<DT id="3639"><B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I><DD>


Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling parameters
for machine type <I>cpu_type</I>.  Supported values for <I>cpu_type</I> are

<P>


Native Solaris and GNU/Linux toolchains also support the value <B>native</B>,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
<B>-mcpu=native</B> has no effect if <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> does not recognize
the processor.

By default (unless configured otherwise), <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates code for the V7
variant of the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT> architecture.  With <B>-mcpu=cypress</B>, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the Cypress <FONT SIZE="-1">CY7C602</FONT> chip, as used in the
SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series.  This is also appropriate for the older
SPARCStation 1, 2, <FONT SIZE="-1">IPX</FONT> etc.


<P>


With <B>-mcpu=v8</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates code for the V8 variant of the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT>

<P>


With <B>-mcpu=sparclet</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates code for the SPARClet variant of
the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT> architecture.  This adds the integer multiply, multiply/accumulate,
integer divide step and scan (<TT>&quot;ffs&quot;</TT>) instructions which exist in SPARClet
but not in <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC-V7.</FONT>  With <B>-mcpu=tsc701</B>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the <FONT SIZE="-1">TEMIC</FONT> SPARClet chip.


<P>


With <B>-mcpu=v9</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates code for the V9 variant of the <FONT SIZE="-1">SPARC</FONT>
architecture.  This adds 64-bit integer and floating-point move instructions,
3 additional floating-point condition code registers and conditional move
instructions.  With <B>-mcpu=ultrasparc</B>, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi chips.  With
<B>-mcpu=ultrasparc3</B>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
Sun UltraSPARC III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+ chips.  With

<B>-mwarn-reloc</B> generates a warning instead.
<DT id="3695"><B>-msafe-dma</B><DD>



<DT id="3696"><B>-munsafe-dma</B><DD>



Instructions that initiate or test completion of <FONT SIZE="-1">DMA</FONT> must not be
reordered with respect to loads and stores of the memory that is being
accessed.
With <B>-munsafe-dma</B> you must use the <TT>&quot;volatile&quot;</TT> keyword to protect
memory accesses, but that can lead to inefficient code in places where the
memory is known to not change.  Rather than mark the memory as volatile,
you can use <B>-msafe-dma</B> to tell the compiler to treat
the <FONT SIZE="-1">DMA</FONT> instructions as potentially affecting all memory.
<DT id="3697"><B>-mbranch-hints</B><DD>


By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates a branch hint instruction to avoid
pipeline stalls for always-taken or probably-taken branches.  A hint
is not generated closer than 8 instructions away from its branch.
There is little reason to disable them, except for debugging purposes,

<DT id="3698"><B>-msmall-mem</B><DD>



<DT id="3699"><B>-mlarge-mem</B><DD>



By default, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates code assuming that addresses are never larger

<DT id="3701"><B>-mfixed-range=</B><I>register-range</I><DD>


Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is

Compile code assuming that pointers to the <FONT SIZE="-1">PPU</FONT> address space accessed
via the <TT>&quot;__ea&quot;</TT> named address space qualifier are either 32 or 64
bits wide.  The default is 32 bits.  As this is an ABI-changing option,
all object code in an executable must be compiled with the same setting.
<DT id="3704"><B>-maddress-space-conversion</B><DD>



<DT id="3705"><B>-mno-address-space-conversion</B><DD>



Allow/disallow treating the <TT>&quot;__ea&quot;</TT> address space as superset
of the generic address space.  This enables explicit type casts
between <TT>&quot;__ea&quot;</TT> and generic pointer as well as implicit
conversions of generic pointers to <TT>&quot;__ea&quot;</TT> pointers.  The
default is to allow address space pointer conversions.
<DT id="3706"><B>-mcache-size=</B><I>cache-size</I><DD>


This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects a software-managed cache for accessing variables

<DT id="3707"><B>-matomic-updates</B><DD>



<DT id="3708"><B>-mno-atomic-updates</B><DD>



This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an

to a <FONT SIZE="-1">PPU</FONT> variable from <FONT SIZE="-1">SPU</FONT> code using the <TT>&quot;__ea&quot;</TT> named address space
qualifier do not interfere with changes to other <FONT SIZE="-1">PPU</FONT> variables residing
in the same cache line from <FONT SIZE="-1">PPU</FONT> code.  If you do not use atomic updates,
such interference may occur; however, writing back cache lines is

These <B>-m</B> options are defined for V850 implementations:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3728"><B>-mlong-calls</B><DD>



<DT id="3729"><B>-mno-long-calls</B><DD>



Treat all calls as being far away (near).  If calls are assumed to be

<DT id="3730"><B>-mno-ep</B><DD>



<DT id="3731"><B>-mep</B><DD>



Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same index
pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the <TT>&quot;ep&quot;</TT> register, and
use the shorter <TT>&quot;sld&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;sst&quot;</TT> instructions.  The <B>-mep</B>
option is on by default if you optimize.

<DT id="3733"><B>-mprolog-function</B><DD>



Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore registers
at the prologue and epilogue of a function.  The external functions
are slower, but use less code space if more than one function saves
the same number of registers.  The <B>-mprolog-function</B> option
is on by default if you optimize.
<DT id="3734"><B>-mspace</B><DD>


Try to make the code as small as possible.  At present, this just turns
on the <B>-mep</B> and <B>-mprolog-function</B> options.
<DT id="3735"><B>-mtda=</B><I>n</I><DD>


Put static or global variables whose size is <I>n</I> bytes or less into

<TT>&quot;__FPU_OK__&quot;</TT> is defined, otherwise the symbol
<TT>&quot;__NO_FPU__&quot;</TT> is defined.
<DT id="3754"><B>-mloop</B><DD>


Enables the use of the e3v5 <FONT SIZE="-1">LOOP</FONT> instruction.  The use of this
instruction is not enabled by default when the e3v5 architecture is

<DT id="3773"><B>-mno-8byte-align</B><DD>



Enables support for <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;long long&quot;</TT> types to be
aligned on 8-byte boundaries.  The default is to restrict the
alignment of all objects to at most 4-bytes.  When
<B>-m8byte-align</B> is in effect the C preprocessor symbol
<TT>&quot;__V850_8BYTE_ALIGN__&quot;</TT> is defined.
<DT id="3774"><B>-mbig-switch</B><DD>


Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if
the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.
<DT id="3775"><B>-mapp-regs</B><DD>


This option causes r2 and r5 to be used in the code generated by
the compiler.  This setting is the default.
<DT id="3776"><B>-mno-app-regs</B><DD>


This option causes r2 and r5 to be treated as fixed registers.

<I>Visium Options</I>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3780"><B>-mdebug</B><DD>


A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on an <FONT SIZE="-1">MCM</FONT> target
should be linked with this option.  It causes the libraries libc.a and
libdebug.a to be linked.  The program should be run on the target under
the control of the <FONT SIZE="-1">GDB</FONT> remote debugging stub.
<DT id="3781"><B>-msim</B><DD>


A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on the simulator

<DT id="3783"><B>-mhard-float</B><DD>



Generate code containing floating-point instructions.  This is the
default.
<DT id="3784"><B>-mno-fpu</B><DD>



<DT id="3785"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>



Generate code containing library calls for floating-point.


<P>


<B>-msoft-float</B> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <I>all</I> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <I>libgcc.a</I>, the
library that comes with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> with <B>-msoft-float</B> in order for
this to work.
<DT id="3786"><B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I><DD>


Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling parameters
for machine type <I>cpu_type</I>.  Supported values for <I>cpu_type</I> are
<B>mcm</B>, <B>gr5</B> and <B>gr6</B>.


<P>


<B>mcm</B> is a synonym of <B>gr5</B> present for backward compatibility.


<P>


By default (unless configured otherwise), <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates code for the <FONT SIZE="-1">GR5</FONT>
variant of the Visium architecture.


<P>


With <B>-mcpu=gr6</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> generates code for the <FONT SIZE="-1">GR6</FONT> variant of the Visium
architecture.  The only difference from <FONT SIZE="-1">GR5</FONT> code is that the compiler will
generate block move instructions.
<DT id="3787"><B>-mtune=</B><I>cpu_type</I><DD>


Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type <I>cpu_type</I>,
but do not set the instruction set or register set that the option
<B>-mcpu=</B><I>cpu_type</I> would.
<DT id="3788"><B>-msv-mode</B><DD>


Generate code for the supervisor mode, where there are no restrictions on
the access to general registers.  This is the default.
<DT id="3789"><B>-muser-mode</B><DD>


Generate code for the user mode, where the access to some general registers
is forbidden: on the <FONT SIZE="-1">GR5,</FONT> registers r24 to r31 cannot be accessed in this

condition (e.g. error) codes.
<DT id="3791"><B>-mdebug-main=</B><I>prefix</I><DD>


Flag the first routine whose name starts with <I>prefix</I> as the main
routine for the debugger.
<DT id="3792"><B>-mmalloc64</B><DD>


Default to 64-bit memory allocation routines.
<DT id="3793"><B>-mpointer-size=</B><I>size</I><DD>


Set the default size of pointers. Possible options for <I>size</I> are
<B>32</B> or <B>short</B> for 32 bit pointers, <B>64</B> or <B>long</B>
for 64 bit pointers, and <B>no</B> for supporting only 32 bit pointers.
The later option disables <TT>&quot;pragma pointer_size&quot;</TT>.

<DT id="3794"><B>-mrtp</B><DD>


<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and real time processes
(RTPs).  This option switches from the former to the latter.  It also
defines the preprocessor macro <TT>&quot;__RTP__&quot;</TT>.
<DT id="3795"><B>-non-static</B><DD>


Link an <FONT SIZE="-1">RTP</FONT> executable against shared libraries rather than static
libraries.  The options <B>-static</B> and <B>-shared</B> can
also be used for RTPs; <B>-static</B>
is the default.
<DT id="3796"><B>-Bstatic</B><DD>



<DT id="3797"><B>-Bdynamic</B><DD>



These options are passed down to the linker.  They are defined for
compatibility with Diab.

Tune to <I>cpu-type</I> everything applicable about the generated code, except
for the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> and the set of available instructions.  
While picking a specific <I>cpu-type</I> schedules things appropriately
for that particular chip, the compiler does not generate any code that
cannot run on the default machine type unless you use a
<B>-march=</B><I>cpu-type</I> option.
For example, if <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is configured for i686-pc-linux-gnu
then <B>-mtune=pentium4</B> generates code that is tuned for Pentium 4
but still runs on i686 machines.


<P>


The choices for <I>cpu-type</I> are the same as for <B>-march</B>.
In addition, <B>-mtune</B> supports 2 extra choices for <I>cpu-type</I>:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3884"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3885"><B>generic</B><DD>


Produce code optimized for the most common <FONT SIZE="-1">IA32/AMD64/EM64T</FONT> processors.
If you know the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> on which your code will run, then you should use
the corresponding <B>-mtune</B> or <B>-march</B> option instead of
<B>-mtune=generic</B>.  But, if you do not know exactly what <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> users
of your application will have, then you should use this option.


<P>


As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this
option will change.  Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC,</FONT> code generation controlled by this option will change to reflect
the processors
that are most common at the time that version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> is released.


<P>


There is no <B>-march=generic</B> option because <B>-march</B>
indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no
generic instruction set applicable to all processors.  In contrast,
<B>-mtune</B> indicates the processor (or, in this case, collection of
processors) for which the code is optimized.
<DT id="3886"><B>intel</B><DD>


Produce code optimized for the most current Intel processors, which are
Haswell and Silvermont for this version of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>  If you know the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT>
on which your code will run, then you should use the corresponding
<B>-mtune</B> or <B>-march</B> option instead of <B>-mtune=intel</B>.
But, if you want your application performs better on both Haswell and
Silvermont, then you should use this option.

A deprecated synonym for <B>-mtune</B>.
<DT id="3889"><B>-mfpmath=</B><I>unit</I><DD>


Generate floating-point arithmetic for selected unit <I>unit</I>.  The choices
for <I>unit</I> are:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="3890"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="3891"><B>387</B><DD>


Use the standard 387 floating-point coprocessor present on the majority of chips and
emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with this option runs almost everywhere.
The temporary results are computed in 80-bit precision instead of the precision
specified by the type, resulting in slightly different results compared to most
of other chips.  See <B>-ffloat-store</B> for more detailed description.


<P>


This is the default choice for non-Darwin x86-32 targets.
<DT id="3892"><B>sse</B><DD>


Use scalar floating-point instructions present in the <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> instruction set.
This instruction set is supported by Pentium <FONT SIZE="-1">III</FONT> and newer chips,
and in the <FONT SIZE="-1">AMD</FONT> line
by Athlon-4, Athlon <FONT SIZE="-1">XP</FONT> and Athlon <FONT SIZE="-1">MP</FONT> chips.  The earlier version of the <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT>
instruction set supports only single-precision arithmetic, thus the double and
extended-precision arithmetic are still done using 387.  A later version, present
only in Pentium 4 and <FONT SIZE="-1">AMD</FONT> x86-64 chips, supports double-precision
arithmetic too.


<P>


For the x86-32 compiler, you must use <B>-march=</B><I>cpu-type</I>, <B>-msse</B>
or <B>-msse2</B> switches to enable <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> extensions and make this option
effective.  For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default.


<P>


The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid
the numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing
code that expects temporaries to be 80 bits.


<P>


This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler, Darwin x86-32 targets,
and the default choice for x86-32 targets with the <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE2</FONT> instruction set
when <B>-ffast-math</B> is enabled.
<DT id="3893"><B>sse,387</B><DD>



<DT id="3894"><B>sse+387</B><DD>


<DT id="3895"><B>both</B><DD>



Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This effectively doubles the
amount of available registers, and on chips with separate execution units for
387 and <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> the execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
still experimental, because the <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> register allocator does not model separate
functional units well, resulting in unstable performance.

<DT id="3899"><B>-mno-ieee-fp</B><DD>

<DT id="3900"><B>-m80387</B><DD>



<DT id="3901"><B>-mhard-float</B><DD>



Generate output containing 80387 instructions for floating point.
<DT id="3902"><B>-mno-80387</B><DD>



<DT id="3903"><B>-msoft-float</B><DD>



Generate output containing library calls for floating point.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> the requisite libraries are not part of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.


<P>


On machines where a function returns floating-point results in the 80387
register stack, some floating-point opcodes may be emitted even if
<B>-msoft-float</B> is used.
<DT id="3904"><B>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</B><DD>


Do not use the <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> registers for return values of functions.


<P>


The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
<TT>&quot;float&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> in an <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> register, even if there
is no <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU.</FONT>  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU.</FONT>


<P>


The option <B>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</B> causes such values to be returned
in ordinary <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> registers instead.
<DT id="3905"><B>-mno-fancy-math-387</B><DD>


Some 387 emulators do not support the <TT>&quot;sin&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;cos&quot;</TT> and
<TT>&quot;sqrt&quot;</TT> instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions.
This option is overridden when <B>-march</B>
indicates that the target <FONT SIZE="-1">CPU</FONT> always has an <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT> and so the
instruction does not need emulation.  These
instructions are not generated unless you also use the
<B>-funsafe-math-optimizations</B> switch.
<DT id="3906"><B>-malign-double</B><DD>



<DT id="3907"><B>-mno-align-double</B><DD>



Control whether <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> aligns <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>, and
<TT>&quot;long long&quot;</TT> variables on a two-word boundary or a one-word
boundary.  Aligning <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> variables on a two-word boundary
produces code that runs somewhat faster on a Pentium at the
expense of more memory.


<P>


On x86-64, <B>-malign-double</B> is enabled by default.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you use the <B>-malign-double</B> switch,
structures containing the above types are aligned differently than
the published application binary interface specifications for the x86-32
and are not binary compatible with structures in code compiled
without that switch.
<DT id="3908"><B>-m96bit-long-double</B><DD>



<DT id="3909"><B>-m128bit-long-double</B><DD>



These switches control the size of <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> type.  The x86-32
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits,
so <B>-m96bit-long-double</B> is the default in 32-bit mode.


<P>


Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) prefer <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>
to be aligned to an 8- or 16-byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
conforming to the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> this is not possible.  So specifying
<B>-m128bit-long-double</B> aligns <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>
to a 16-byte boundary by padding the <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> with an additional
32-bit zero.


<P>


In the x86-64 compiler, <B>-m128bit-long-double</B> is the default choice as
its <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> specifies that <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> is aligned on 16-byte boundary.


<P>


Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87
standard of 80 bits for a <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you override the default value for your target <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> this
changes the size of 
structures and arrays containing <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> variables,
as well as modifying the function calling convention for functions taking
<TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>.  Hence they are not binary-compatible
with code compiled without that switch.
<DT id="3910"><B>-mlong-double-64</B><DD>



<DT id="3911"><B>-mlong-double-80</B><DD>


<DT id="3912"><B>-mlong-double-128</B><DD>



These switches control the size of <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> type. A size
of 64 bits makes the <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> type equivalent to the <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT>
type. This is the default for 32-bit Bionic C library.  A size
of 128 bits makes the <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> type equivalent to the
<TT>&quot;__float128&quot;</TT> type. This is the default for 64-bit Bionic C library.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you override the default value for your target <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI,</FONT> this
changes the size of
structures and arrays containing <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> variables,
as well as modifying the function calling convention for functions taking
<TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT>.  Hence they are not binary-compatible
with code compiled without that switch.
<DT id="3913"><B>-malign-data=</B><I>type</I><DD>


Control how <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> aligns variables.  Supported values for <I>type</I> are
<B>compat</B> uses increased alignment value compatible uses <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC 4.8</FONT>
and earlier, <B>abi</B> uses alignment value as specified by the
psABI, and <B>cacheline</B> uses increased alignment value to match
the cache line size.  <B>compat</B> is the default.
<DT id="3914"><B>-mlarge-data-threshold=</B><I>threshold</I><DD>


When <B>-mcmodel=medium</B> is specified, data objects larger than
<I>threshold</I> are placed in the large data section.  This value must be the
same across all objects linked into the binary, and defaults to 65535.
<DT id="3915"><B>-mrtd</B><DD>


Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the <TT>&quot;ret </TT>num<TT>&quot;</TT>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.


<P>


You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute <TT>&quot;stdcall&quot;</TT>.  You can also
override the <B>-mrtd</B> option by using the function attribute
<TT>&quot;cdecl&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.


<P>


Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <TT>&quot;printf&quot;</TT>);
otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those
functions.


<P>


In addition, seriously incorrect code results if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)
<DT id="3916"><B>-mregparm=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute <TT>&quot;regparm&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you use this switch, and
<I>num</I> is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and
startup modules.
<DT id="3917"><B>-msseregparm</B><DD>


Use <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> register passing conventions for float and double arguments
and return values.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute <TT>&quot;sseregparm&quot;</TT>.


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> if you use this switch then you must build all
modules with the same value, including any libraries.  This includes
the system libraries and startup modules.
<DT id="3918"><B>-mvect8-ret-in-mem</B><DD>


Return 8-byte vectors in memory instead of <FONT SIZE="-1">MMX</FONT> registers.  This is the
default on Solaris@tie{}8 and 9 and VxWorks to match the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> of the Sun
Studio compilers until version 12.  Later compiler versions (starting
with Studio 12 Update@tie{}1) follow the <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> used by other x86 targets, which
is the default on Solaris@tie{}10 and later.  <I>Only</I> use this option if
you need to remain compatible with existing code produced by those
previous compiler versions or older versions of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
<DT id="3919"><B>-mpc32</B><DD>



<DT id="3920"><B>-mpc64</B><DD>


<DT id="3921"><B>-mpc80</B><DD>



Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.  When <B>-mpc32</B>
is specified, the significands of results of floating-point operations are
rounded to 24 bits (single precision); <B>-mpc64</B> rounds the
significands of results of floating-point operations to 53 bits (double
precision) and <B>-mpc80</B> rounds the significands of results of
floating-point operations to 64 bits (extended double precision), which is
the default.  When this option is used, floating-point operations in higher
precisions are not available to the programmer without setting the <FONT SIZE="-1">FPU</FONT>
control word explicitly.


<P>


Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to less than the default
80 bits can speed some programs by 2% or more.  Note that some mathematical
libraries assume that extended-precision (80-bit) floating-point operations
are enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer significant
loss of accuracy, typically through so-called ``catastrophic cancellation'',
when this option is used to set the precision to less than extended precision.
<DT id="3922"><B>-mstackrealign</B><DD>


Realign the stack at entry.  On the x86, the <B>-mstackrealign</B>
option generates an alternate prologue and epilogue that realigns the
run-time stack if necessary.  This supports mixing legacy codes that keep
4-byte stack alignment with modern codes that keep 16-byte stack alignment for
<FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> compatibility.  See also the attribute <TT>&quot;force_align_arg_pointer&quot;</TT>,
applicable to individual functions.
<DT id="3923"><B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <I>num</I>
byte boundary.  If <B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</B> is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).


<P>


<B>Warning:</B> When generating code for the x86-64 architecture with
<FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT> extensions disabled, <B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</B> can be
used to keep the stack boundary aligned to 8 byte boundary.  Since
x86-64 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> require 16 byte stack alignment, this is <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> incompatible and
intended to be used in controlled environment where stack space is
important limitation.  This option leads to wrong code when functions
compiled with 16 byte stack alignment (such as functions from a standard
library) are called with misaligned stack.  In this case, <FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT>
instructions may lead to misaligned memory access traps.  In addition,
variable arguments are handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned
objects (including x87 long double and __int128), leading to wrong
results.  You must build all modules with
<B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</B>, including any libraries.  This
includes the system libraries and startup modules.
<DT id="3924"><B>-mincoming-stack-boundary=</B><I>num</I><DD>


Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to <I>num</I> byte
boundary.  If <B>-mincoming-stack-boundary</B> is not specified,
the one specified by <B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</B> is used.


<P>


On Pentium and Pentium Pro, <TT>&quot;double&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;long double&quot;</TT> values
should be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (see <B>-malign-double</B>) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium <FONT SIZE="-1">III,</FONT> the
Streaming <FONT SIZE="-1">SIMD</FONT> Extension (<FONT SIZE="-1">SSE</FONT>) data type <TT>&quot;__m128&quot;</TT> may not work
properly if it is not 16-byte aligned.


<P>


To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.


<P>


This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to <B>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</B>.

<DT id="4000"><B>-mcld</B><DD>


This option instructs <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to emit a <TT>&quot;cld&quot;</TT> instruction in the prologue
of functions that use string instructions.  String instructions depend on
the <FONT SIZE="-1">DF</FONT> flag to select between autoincrement or autodecrement mode.  While the

systems violate this specification by not clearing the <FONT SIZE="-1">DF</FONT> flag in their

set, which leads to wrong direction mode when string instructions are used.
This option can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86 targets by configuring
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> with the <B>--enable-cld</B> configure option.  Generation of <TT>&quot;cld&quot;</TT>

Early Intel Pentium 4 CPUs with Intel 64 support,

This option enables use of <TT>&quot;RCPSS&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;RSQRTSS&quot;</TT> instructions
(and their vectorized variants <TT>&quot;RCPPS&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;RSQRTPS&quot;</TT>)
with an additional Newton-Raphson step
to increase precision instead of <TT>&quot;DIVSS&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;SQRTSS&quot;</TT>

together with <B>-ffinite-math-only</B> and <B>-fno-trapping-math</B>.
Note that while the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be
decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).

<B>ms</B> for the Microsoft <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI.</FONT>  The default is to use the Microsoft

You can control this behavior for specific functions by

<DT id="4028"><B>-mforce-indirect-call</B><DD>


Force all calls to functions to be indirect. This is useful
when using Intel Processor Trace where it generates more precise timing
information for function calls.
<DT id="4029"><B>-mmanual-endbr</B><DD>


Insert <FONT SIZE="-1">ENDBR</FONT> instruction at function entry only via the <TT>&quot;cf_check&quot;</TT>

<B>-fcf-protection=branch</B> to control <FONT SIZE="-1">ENDBR</FONT> insertion at the

<DT id="4030"><B>-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues</B><DD>


Due to differences in 64-bit ABIs, any Microsoft <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> function that calls a
System V <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> function must consider <FONT SIZE="-1">RSI, RDI</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">XMM6-15</FONT> as clobbered.  By
default, the code for saving and restoring these registers is emitted inline,
resulting in fairly lengthy prologues and epilogues.  Using
<B>-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues</B> emits prologues and epilogues that
use stubs in the static portion of libgcc to perform these saves and restores,
thus reducing function size at the cost of a few extra instructions.
<DT id="4031"><B>-mtls-dialect=</B><I>type</I><DD>


Generate code to access thread-local storage using the <B>gnu</B> or
<B>gnu2</B> conventions.  <B>gnu</B> is the conservative default;

<DT id="4033"><B>-mno-push-args</B><DD>



Use <FONT SIZE="-1">PUSH</FONT> operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter
and usually equally fast as method using <FONT SIZE="-1">SUB/MOV</FONT> operations and is enabled
by default.  In some cases disabling it may improve performance because of
improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.
<DT id="4034"><B>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</B><DD>


If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments is
computed in the function prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs
because of reduced dependencies, improved scheduling and reduced stack usage
when the preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a notable
increase in code size.  This switch implies <B>-mno-push-args</B>.
<DT id="4035"><B>-mthreads</B><DD>


Support thread-safe exception handling on MinGW.  Programs that rely
on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all code with the

<B>-D_MT</B>; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library
<B>-lmingwthrd</B> which cleans up per-thread exception-handling data.
<DT id="4036"><B>-mms-bitfields</B><DD>



<DT id="4037"><B>-mno-ms-bitfields</B><DD>



Enable/disable bit-field layout compatible with the native Microsoft
Windows compiler.


<P>


If <TT>&quot;packed&quot;</TT> is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used,
it may be that the Microsoft <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT> lays out the structure differently
than the way <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> normally does.  Particularly when moving packed
data between functions compiled with <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> and the native Microsoft compiler
(either via function call or as data in a file), it may be necessary to access
either format.


<P>


This option is enabled by default for Microsoft Windows
targets.  This behavior can also be controlled locally by use of variable
or type attributes.  For more information, see <B>x86 Variable Attributes</B>
and <B>x86 Type Attributes</B>.


<P>


The Microsoft structure layout algorithm is fairly simple with the exception
of the bit-field packing.  
The padding and alignment of members of structures and whether a bit-field 
can straddle a storage-unit boundary are determine by these rules:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="4038"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4039">1. Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in which they are<DD>


declared: the first member has the lowest memory address and the last member
the highest.
<DT id="4040">2. Every data object has an alignment requirement.  The alignment requirement<DD>


for all data except structures, unions, and arrays is either the size of the
object or the current packing size (specified with either the
<TT>&quot;aligned&quot;</TT> attribute or the <TT>&quot;pack&quot;</TT> pragma),
whichever is less.  For structures, unions, and arrays,
the alignment requirement is the largest alignment requirement of its members.
Every object is allocated an offset so that:


<P>




<PRE>
        offset % alignment_requirement == 0

</PRE>


<DT id="4041">3. Adjacent bit-fields are packed into the same 1-, 2-, or 4-byte allocation<DD>


unit if the integral types are the same size and if the next bit-field fits
into the current allocation unit without crossing the boundary imposed by the
common alignment requirements of the bit-fields.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="4042"><DD>


<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">MSVC</FONT> interprets zero-length bit-fields in the following ways:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4043">1. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted between two bit-fields that<DD>


are normally coalesced, the bit-fields are not coalesced.


<P>


For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct
         {
           unsigned long bf_1 : 12;
           unsigned long : 0;
           unsigned long bf_2 : 12;
         } t1;

</PRE>




<P>


The size of <TT>&quot;t1&quot;</TT> is 8 bytes with the zero-length bit-field.  If the
zero-length bit-field were removed, <TT>&quot;t1&quot;</TT>'s size would be 4 bytes.
<DT id="4044">2. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted after a bit-field, &quot;foo&quot;, and the<DD>




alignment of the zero-length bit-field is greater than the member that follows it,
<TT>&quot;bar&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bar&quot;</TT> is aligned as the type of the zero-length bit-field.


<P>


For example:


<P>




<PRE>
        struct
         {
           char foo : 4;
           short : 0;
           char bar;
         } t2;
        
        struct
         {
           char foo : 4;
           short : 0;
           double bar;
         } t3;

</PRE>




<P>


For <TT>&quot;t2&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;bar&quot;</TT> is placed at offset 2, rather than offset 1.
Accordingly, the size of <TT>&quot;t2&quot;</TT> is 4.  For <TT>&quot;t3&quot;</TT>, the zero-length
bit-field does not affect the alignment of <TT>&quot;bar&quot;</TT> or, as a result, the size
of the structure.


<P>


Taking this into account, it is important to note the following:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4046">1. If a zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field, the type of the<DD>


zero-length bit-field may affect the alignment of the structure as whole. For

normal bit-field, and is of type short.
<DT id="4047">2. Even if a zero-length bit-field is not followed by a normal bit-field, it may<DD>

<P>


The <B>-m16</B> option is the same as <B>-m32</B>, except for that
it outputs the <TT>&quot;.code16gcc&quot;</TT> assembly directive at the beginning of
the assembly output so that the binary can run in 16-bit mode.


<P>


The <B>-miamcu</B> option generates code which conforms to Intel <FONT SIZE="-1">MCU</FONT>
psABI.  It requires the <B>-m32</B> option to be turned on.
<DT id="4100"><B>-mno-red-zone</B><DD>


Do not use a so-called ``red zone'' for x86-64 code.  The red zone is mandated
by the x86-64 <FONT SIZE="-1">ABI</FONT>; it is a 128-byte area beyond the location of the
stack pointer that is not modified by signal or interrupt handlers
and therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack
pointer.  The flag <B>-mno-red-zone</B> disables this red zone.
<DT id="4101"><B>-mcmodel=small</B><DD>


Generate code for the small code model: the program and its symbols must
be linked in the lower 2 <FONT SIZE="-1">GB</FONT> of the address space.  Pointers are 64 bits.
Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.  This is the default
code model.
<DT id="4102"><B>-mcmodel=kernel</B><DD>


Generate code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in the

<DT id="4107"><B>-mconsole</B><DD>


This option
specifies that a console application is to be generated, by
instructing the linker to set the <FONT SIZE="-1">PE</FONT> header subsystem type
required for console applications.
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets and is
enabled by default on those targets.
<DT id="4108"><B>-mdll</B><DD>


This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that a DLL---a dynamic link library---is to be
generated, enabling the selection of the required runtime
startup object and entry point.
<DT id="4109"><B>-mnop-fun-dllimport</B><DD>


This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that the <TT>&quot;dllimport&quot;</TT> attribute should be ignored.
<DT id="4110"><B>-mthread</B><DD>


This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies
that MinGW-specific thread support is to be used.
<DT id="4111"><B>-municode</B><DD>


This option is available for MinGW-w64 targets.  It causes
the <TT>&quot;UNICODE&quot;</TT> preprocessor macro to be predefined, and
chooses Unicode-capable runtime startup code.
<DT id="4112"><B>-mwin32</B><DD>


This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that the typical Microsoft Windows predefined macros are to
be set in the pre-processor, but does not influence the choice
of runtime library/startup code.
<DT id="4113"><B>-mwindows</B><DD>


This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that a <FONT SIZE="-1">GUI</FONT> application is to be generated by
instructing the linker to set the <FONT SIZE="-1">PE</FONT> header subsystem type
appropriately.
<DT id="4114"><B>-fno-set-stack-executable</B><DD>


This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that
the executable flag for the stack used by nested functions isn't
set. This is necessary for binaries running in kernel mode of
Microsoft Windows, as there the User32 <FONT SIZE="-1">API,</FONT> which is used to set executable
privileges, isn't available.
<DT id="4115"><B>-fwritable-relocated-rdata</B><DD>


This option is available for MinGW and Cygwin targets.  It specifies
that relocated-data in read-only section is put into the <TT>&quot;.data&quot;</TT>

modification of <TT>&quot;.rdata&quot;</TT> sections for pseudo-relocation.
<DT id="4116"><B>-mpe-aligned-commons</B><DD>


This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
specifies that the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> extension to the <FONT SIZE="-1">PE</FONT> file format that

<I>Xtensa Options</I>


<P>

These options are supported for Xtensa targets:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4118"><B>-mconst16</B><DD>



<DT id="4119"><B>-mno-const16</B><DD>



Enable or disable use of <TT>&quot;CONST16&quot;</TT> instructions for loading
constant values.  The <TT>&quot;CONST16&quot;</TT> instruction is currently not a
standard option from Tensilica.  When enabled, <TT>&quot;CONST16&quot;</TT>
instructions are always used in place of the standard <TT>&quot;L32R&quot;</TT>
instructions.  The use of <TT>&quot;CONST16&quot;</TT> is enabled by default only if
the <TT>&quot;L32R&quot;</TT> instruction is not available.
<DT id="4120"><B>-mfused-madd</B><DD>



<DT id="4121"><B>-mno-fused-madd</B><DD>



Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> 754-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with <I>more</I> bits of
precision than specified by the <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.
<DT id="4122"><B>-mserialize-volatile</B><DD>



<DT id="4123"><B>-mno-serialize-volatile</B><DD>



When this option is enabled, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> inserts <TT>&quot;MEMW&quot;</TT> instructions before
<TT>&quot;volatile&quot;</TT> memory references to guarantee sequential consistency.
The default is <B>-mserialize-volatile</B>.  Use
<B>-mno-serialize-volatile</B> to omit the <TT>&quot;MEMW&quot;</TT> instructions.
<DT id="4124"><B>-mforce-no-pic</B><DD>


For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must be
position-independent code (<FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT>), this option disables <FONT SIZE="-1">PIC</FONT> for compiling
kernel code.
<DT id="4125"><B>-mtext-section-literals</B><DD>



<DT id="4126"><B>-mno-text-section-literals</B><DD>



These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
<B>-mno-text-section-literals</B>, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed
in a data <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM/ROM,</FONT> and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With <B>-mtext-section-literals</B>, the literals
are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly
files.  Literals for each function are placed right before that function.
<DT id="4127"><B>-mauto-litpools</B><DD>



<DT id="4128"><B>-mno-auto-litpools</B><DD>



These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
<B>-mno-auto-litpools</B>, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file unless <B>-mtext-section-literals</B> is
used.  With <B>-mauto-litpools</B> the literals are interspersed in
the text section by the assembler.  Compiler does not produce explicit
<TT>&quot;.literal&quot;</TT> directives and loads literals into registers with
<TT>&quot;MOVI&quot;</TT> instructions instead of <TT>&quot;L32R&quot;</TT> to let the assembler
do relaxation and place literals as necessary.  This option allows
assembler to create several literal pools per function and assemble
very big functions, which may not be possible with
<B>-mtext-section-literals</B>.
<DT id="4129"><B>-mtarget-align</B><DD>



<DT id="4130"><B>-mno-target-align</B><DD>



When this option is enabled, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening is performed.  The
default is <B>-mtarget-align</B>.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like <TT>&quot;LOOP&quot;</TT>, which the
assembler always aligns, either by widening density instructions or
by inserting <FONT SIZE="-1">NOP</FONT> instructions.
<DT id="4131"><B>-mlongcalls</B><DD>



<DT id="4132"><B>-mno-longcalls</B><DD>



When this option is enabled, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct <TT>&quot;CALL&quot;</TT>
instruction into an <TT>&quot;L32R&quot;</TT> followed by a <TT>&quot;CALLX&quot;</TT> instruction.
The default is <B>-mno-longcalls</B>.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> still shows direct call
instructions---look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.

<I>zSeries Options</I>


<P>

These are listed under
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>



This section describes several environment variables that affect how <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
<P>

Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<B>-B</B>, <B>-I</B> and <B>-L</B>.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC.</FONT>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4133"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B><DD>



<DT id="4134"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


<DT id="4135"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


<DT id="4136"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_ALL</B></FONT><B></B><DD>



These environment variables control the way that <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses
localization information which allows <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> to work with different
national conventions.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> inspects the locale categories
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B> and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is <B>en_GB.UTF-8</B> for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8.</FONT>


<P>


The <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable specifies character
classification.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string
end or escape.


<P>


The <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.


<P>


If the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_ALL</B></FONT><B></B> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B> and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B>; otherwise, <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_CTYPE</B></FONT><B></B>
and <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LC_MESSAGES</B></FONT><B></B> default to the value of the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT>
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
<DT id="4137"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>TMPDIR</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


If <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>TMPDIR</B></FONT><B></B> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
<DT id="4138"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


Setting <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</B></FONT><B></B> is nearly equivalent to passing
<B>-fcompare-debug</B> to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.
<DT id="4139"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


If <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.


<P>


If <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> is not set, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> attempts to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.


<P>


If <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.


<P>


The default value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> is
<I>prefix/lib/gcc/</I> where <I>prefix</I> is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases <I>prefix</I> is the value
of <TT>&quot;prefix&quot;</TT> when you ran the <I>configure</I> script.


<P>


Other prefixes specified with <B>-B</B> take precedence over this prefix.


<P>


This prefix is also used for finding files such as <I>crt0.o</I> that are
used for linking.


<P>


In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <B>/usr/local/lib/gcc</B>
(more precisely, with the value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</B></FONT><B></B>), <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <B>-Bfoo/</B>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> searches
<I>foo/bar</I> just before it searches the standard directory 
<I>/usr/local/lib/bar</I>.
If a standard directory begins with the configured
<I>prefix</I> then the value of <I>prefix</I> is replaced by
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B> when looking for header files.
<DT id="4140"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>COMPILER_PATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


The value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>COMPILER_PATH</B></FONT><B></B> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B>.  <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it cannot find the
subprograms using <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.
<DT id="4141"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LIBRARY_PATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


The value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LIBRARY_PATH</B></FONT><B></B> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B>.  When configured as a native compiler,
<FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it cannot find them using <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></FONT><B></B>.  Linking
using <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <B>-l</B> option (but directories specified with
<B>-L</B> come first).
<DT id="4142"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B> are recognized:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="4143"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4144"><B>C-JIS</B><DD>


Recognize <FONT SIZE="-1">JIS</FONT> characters.
<DT id="4145"><B>C-SJIS</B><DD>


Recognize <FONT SIZE="-1">SJIS</FONT> characters.
<DT id="4146"><B>C-EUCJP</B><DD>


Recognize <FONT SIZE="-1">EUCJP</FONT> characters.
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT id="4147"><DD>


<P>


If <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LANG</B></FONT><B></B> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses <TT>&quot;mblen&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;mbtowc&quot;</TT> as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="4148"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>



<DT id="4149"><B>C_INCLUDE_PATH</B><DD>


<DT id="4150"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


<DT id="4151"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>



Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B></FONT><B></B>, in which to look for header files.
The special character, <TT>&quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;</TT>, is target-dependent and
determined at <FONT SIZE="-1">GCC</FONT> build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.


<P>


<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPATH</B></FONT><B></B> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <B>-I</B>, but after any paths given with <B>-I</B>
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.


<P>


The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with <B>-isystem</B>, but after any
paths given with <B>-isystem</B> options on the command line.


<P>


In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
<B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CPATH</B></FONT><B></B> is <TT>&quot;:/special/include&quot;</TT>, that has the same
effect as <B>-I.&nbsp;-I/special/include</B>.
<DT id="4152"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.


<P>


The value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></FONT><B></B> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<I>file</I><B> </B><I>target</I>, in which case the rules are written to
file <I>file</I> using <I>target</I> as the target name.


<P>


In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options <B>-MM</B> and <B>-MF</B>,
with an optional <B>-MT</B> switch too.
<DT id="4153"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


This variable is the same as <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></FONT><B></B> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
<B>-M</B> rather than <B>-MM</B>.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.
<DT id="4154"><B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</B></FONT><B></B><DD>


If this variable is set, its value specifies a <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> timestamp to be
used in replacement of the current date and time in the <TT>&quot;__DATE__&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;__TIME__&quot;</TT> macros, so that the embedded timestamps become
reproducible.


<P>


The value of <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</B></FONT><B></B> must be a <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> timestamp,
defined as the number of seconds (excluding leap seconds) since
01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT>; identical to the output of
<B></B>@command<B>{date +%s</B>} on GNU/Linux and other systems that support the
<TT>%s</TT> extension in the <TT>&quot;date&quot;</TT> command.


<P>


The value should be a known timestamp such as the last modification
time of the source or package and it should be set by the build
process.
