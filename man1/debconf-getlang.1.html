<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



Note: This utility is deprecated; you should switch to using the po-debconf package.
<P>

This program helps make and manage translations of debconf templates.
There are basically three situations in which this program might be called:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="1">A translation is just being started.<DD>


You want to provide the translator with a file they can work on that has the
English fields from your templates file, plus blank Field-ll fields for the
target language that they can fill in.


<P>


To do this, run the program with first parameter being the code for the
language that is being translated to, and the second parameter being the
filename of the English templates file.
<DT id="2">A translation is well under way.<DD>


You have changed some English text, or added more items to your templates
file, and you want to send the translators a file with the English text plus
their current translations (or you are the translator, and you want to
generate such a file for your own use).


<P>


To accomplish this, run the program with the first parameter being the the
code for the language that is being translated to, the second parameter
being the filename of the master English templates file, and the third
parameter being the filename of the current translated file.


<P>


When run this way, the program is smart enough to notice fuzzy
translations. For example a fuzzy Description will be output as
Description-&lt;lang&gt;-fuzzy, and a new, blank Description-&lt;lang&gt; will be added.
Translators should remove the -fuzzy fields as they correct the fuzzy
translations.
<DT id="3">Checking the status of a translation<DD>


To check the status of a translation, use the --status flag, and pass 
the english template file as the first parameter, and all the other
translated templates after that. It will output statistics for each of
them. For example:
