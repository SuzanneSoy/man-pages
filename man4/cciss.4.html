cciss - HP Smart Array block driver
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
modprobe cciss [ cciss_allow_hpsa=1 ]
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<B>Note</B>:

This obsolete driver was removed from the kernel in version 4.14,
as it is superseded by the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?4+hpsa">hpsa</A></B>(4)

driver in newer kernels.
<P>

<B>cciss</B>

is a block driver for older HP Smart Array RAID controllers.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Options</H3>

<I>cciss_allow_hpsa=1</I>:

This option prevents the
<B>cciss</B>

driver from attempting to drive any controllers that the
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?4+hpsa">hpsa</A></B>(4)

driver is capable of controlling, which is to say, the
<B>cciss</B>

driver is restricted by this option to the following controllers:

<H3>Configuration details</H3>

To configure HP Smart Array controllers,
use the HP Array Configuration Utility
(either
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+hpacuxe">hpacuxe</A></B>(8)

or
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+hpacucli">hpacucli</A></B>(8))

or the Offline ROM-based Configuration Utility (ORCA)
run from the Smart Array's option ROM at boot time.

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>SCSI tape drive and medium changer support</H3>

SCSI sequential access devices and medium changer devices are supported and
appropriate device nodes are automatically created (e.g.,
<I>/dev/st0</I>,

<I>/dev/st1</I>,

etc.; see
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?4+st">st</A></B>(4)

for more details.)
You must enable &quot;SCSI tape drive support for Smart Array 5xxx&quot; and
&quot;SCSI support&quot; in your kernel configuration to be able to use SCSI
tape drives with your Smart Array 5xxx controller.
<P>

Additionally, note that the driver will not engage the SCSI core at
init time.
The driver must be directed to dynamically engage the SCSI core via the
<I>/proc</I>

filesystem entry,
which the &quot;block&quot; side of the driver creates as
<I>/proc/driver/cciss/cciss*</I>

at run time.
This is because at driver init time,
the SCSI core may not yet be initialized (because the driver is a block
driver) and attempting to register it with the SCSI core in such a case
would cause a hang.
This is best done via an initialization script
(typically in
<I>/etc/init.d</I>,

but could vary depending on distribution).
For example:
<P>



for x in /proc/driver/cciss/cciss[0-9]*
do
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo&nbsp;&quot;engage&nbsp;scsi&quot;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;$x
done


<P>

Once the SCSI core is engaged by the driver, it cannot be disengaged
(except by unloading the driver, if it happens to be linked as a module.)
<P>

Note also that if no sequential access devices or medium changers are
detected, the SCSI core will not be engaged by the action of the above
script.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Hot plug support for SCSI tape drives</H3>

Hot plugging of SCSI tape drives is supported, with some caveats.
The
<B>cciss</B>

driver must be informed that changes to the SCSI bus
have been made.
This may be done via the
<I>/proc</I>

filesystem.
For example:
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo&nbsp;&quot;rescan&quot;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;/proc/scsi/cciss0/1
<P>

This causes the driver to:
<DL COMPACT><DT id="11"><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="12">1.<DD>
query the adapter about changes to the
physical SCSI buses and/or fibre channel arbitrated loop, and
<DT id="13">2.<DD>
make note of any new or removed sequential access devices
or medium changers.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

The driver will output messages indicating which
devices have been added or removed and the controller, bus, target, and
lun used to address each device.
The driver then notifies the SCSI midlayer
of these changes.
<P>

Note that the naming convention of the
<I>/proc</I>

filesystem entries
contains a number in addition to the driver name
(e.g., &quot;cciss0&quot;
instead of just &quot;cciss&quot;, which you might expect).
<P>

Note:
<I>Only</I>

sequential access devices and medium changers are presented
as SCSI devices to the SCSI midlayer by the
<B>cciss</B>

driver.
Specifically, physical SCSI disk drives are
<I>not</I>

presented to the SCSI midlayer.
The only disk devices that are presented to the kernel are logical
drives that the array controller constructs from regions on
the physical drives.
The logical drives are presented to the block layer
(not to the SCSI midlayer).
It is important for the driver to prevent the kernel from accessing the
physical drives directly, since these drives are used by the array
controller to construct the logical drives.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>SCSI error handling for tape drives and medium changers</H3>

The Linux SCSI midlayer provides an error-handling protocol that
is initiated whenever a SCSI command fails to complete within a
certain amount of time (which can vary depending on the command).
The
<B>cciss</B>

driver participates in this protocol to some extent.
The normal protocol is a four-step process:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT id="14">*<DD>
First, the device is told to abort the command.
<DT id="15">*<DD>
If that doesn't work, the device is reset.
<DT id="16">*<DD>
If that doesn't work, the SCSI bus is reset.
<DT id="17">*<DD>
If that doesn't work, the host bus adapter is reset.
</DL>
<P>

The
<B>cciss</B>

driver is a block
driver as well as a SCSI driver and only the tape drives and medium
changers are presented to the SCSI midlayer.
Furthermore, unlike more
straightforward SCSI drivers, disk I/O continues through the block
side during the SCSI error-recovery process.
Therefore, the
<B>cciss</B>

driver implements only the first two of these actions,
aborting the command, and resetting the device.
Note also that most tape drives will not oblige
in aborting commands, and sometimes it appears they will not even
obey a reset command, though in most circumstances they will.
If the command cannot be aborted and the device cannot be
reset, the device will be set offline.
<P>

In the event that the error-handling code is triggered and a tape drive is
successfully reset or the tardy command is successfully aborted, the
tape drive may still not allow I/O to continue until some command
is issued that positions the tape to a known position.
Typically you must rewind the tape (by issuing
<I>mt -f /dev/st0 rewind</I>

for example) before I/O can proceed again to a tape drive that was reset.
