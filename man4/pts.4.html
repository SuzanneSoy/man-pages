ptmx, pts - pseudoterminal master and slave
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The file
<I>/dev/ptmx</I>

is a character file with major number 5 and
minor number 2, usually with mode 0666 and ownership root:root.
It is used to create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair.
<P>

When a process opens
<I>/dev/ptmx</I>,

it gets a file
descriptor for a pseudoterminal master (PTM),
and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS) device is created in the
<I>/dev/pts</I>

directory.
Each file descriptor obtained by opening
<I>/dev/ptmx</I>

is an independent PTM with its own associated PTS, whose path can
be found by passing the file descriptor to
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+ptsname">ptsname</A></B>(3).

<P>

Before opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master's file
descriptor to
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+grantpt">grantpt</A></B>(3)

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+unlockpt">unlockpt</A></B>(3).

<P>

Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave provides
processes with an interface that is identical to that of a real terminal.
<P>

Data written to the slave is presented on the master file descriptor as input.
Data written to the master is presented to the slave as input.
<P>

In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal emulators
such as
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+xterm">xterm</A></B>(1),

in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is interpreted by the
application in the same way
a real terminal would interpret the data, and for implementing remote-login
programs such as
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+sshd">sshd</A></B>(8),

in which data read from the pseudoterminal master is sent across the network
to a client program that is connected to a terminal or terminal emulator.
<P>

Pseudoterminals can also be used to send input to programs that normally
refuse to read input from pipes (such as
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+su">su</A></B>(1),

and
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+passwd">passwd</A></B>(1)).

<H2>FILES</H2>

<I>/dev/ptmx</I>,

<I>/dev/pts/*</I>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The Linux support for the above (known as UNIX 98 pseudoterminal naming)
is done using the
<I>devpts</I>

filesystem, that should be mounted on
<I>/dev/pts</I>.

<P>

Before this UNIX 98 scheme, master pseudoterminals were called
<I>/dev/ptyp0</I>, ...

and slave pseudoterminals
<I>/dev/ttyp0</I>, ...

and one needed lots of preallocated device nodes.
